# Release Notes - DrCloudEHR GetThingsDone

## Version 2.2.0 - New Features & Improvements

### What's New?
- **Project Rebranding**: Officially renamed to **DrCloudEHR GetThingsDone**.
- **Dark & Light Mode**: The app now looks great in both dark and light modes. We've also dimmed the video brightness in dark mode to make it easier on your eyes.
- **Smart "Jump" Feature**: When you find an action item, you can click "Jump" to go straight to that moment in the video. The transcript will highlight the exact section so you don't lose your place.
- **Central Knowledge Search**: You can now ask questions about *all* your past meetings at once. The AI will search through everything it knows to give you an answer, even if you are currently watching a different video.
- **Smart History Management**: You can now clear your recent media list or delete individual videos. This keeps your workspace clean without losing your data.
- **Instant Re-Upload**: If you upload a video you've processed before, all your previous notes, transcripts, and summaries will appear instantly—no waiting for the AI to work again!
- **Instant Recent Media**: Your uploaded videos and history now load instantly, letting you pick up right where you left off.

### General Improvements
- **Improved Visuals**: Each part of the app (Header, Chat, Action Items, and Transcript) is now more distinct and easier to read.
- **Better Stability**: Fixed several issues that were causing the app to crash or show errors during file loading and database updates.
