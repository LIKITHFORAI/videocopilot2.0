Sometimes it will take five to 10 minutes also. So just we have to wait man. Okay. It is taken. Can we use admin ID on Pearson? Yeah, you can use that account also. But don't use here, madam, because make it separate class that admin is you can use admin development lighting that is separate org. You can use this as a separate CPQ practice only. You can create a number of developer accounts. There is no problem. Just you have to give a different username. That's it. You can create a number of developer account. There is no issues. Clear, madam? What I'm saying? Okay. Okay. Yeah. So this is the URL everyone, not only you, madam. So other people also please use different account for CPQ practice. Don't use a don't use a same org. Great. Clear what I'm saying? Don't oppose them. Deepa madam. Yes. Don't use the same or create a separate org for CPQ practice. So I'm creating new developer account. It is taking time. So meanwhile, what we'll discuss is we'll discuss about. So first, after creating a code, what is the second step we have to do, madam? Install CPQ package. What you have to do, madam, we have to install that sales for CPQ package. Why? Because this class is mainly for CPQ practice, CPQ understanding purpose. So we have to use the CPQ package. So where we can get the CPQ package. If I want to learn CPQ, where we can get the CPQ, how we can learn CPQ, all those things. So we have a separate URL for installing sales for CPQ package. So what is that? So just go to here, type install.steelbrick2.com. So what is the URL we have to use, madam? Install.steelbrick.com. Because this package is developed by CPQ company, steel brick company. So that's why they are giving this is the username. Okay, so use this URL for CPQ package installation. Okay, so if you go to this URL, here you can see, madam, all the latest CPQ related topics. This is normal sales for CPQ. Okay. In case if you want to use CPQ for service cloud, you can use this one. Okay, if you want to CPQ for other billing, I told you yesterday right in the demo class, even if you want to use billing also billing, right, this is upcoming future, there is a good demand for this one also. And all are something billing and CPQ related all the things you can see here. But our focus is on this topic only sales for CPQ only now. So here you can see the latest winter 23 version number. So when it is released actually, okay, number five. So where do you want to install? If you want to install this package in production or sandbox? What is the URL? What is the what is production man developer edition is production sandbox now? This is a production or sandbox now developer edition. Sandbox, what is the URL for sandbox? What is the URL? So that's why what we can consider this one is a production. So here we have to click the production. Okay. So before clicking production, first, we need to activate our app. So we have received email now, just click here. So this is my URL and this is my username, just click a verify account. So once you click verify account, so here we can give a new password, I can give my new password here. So here I can give a new password. So I am creating completely new salesforce developer account. So in the same mark, we are going to use a CPQ package. Once you create an account, so now what you can do, you can install the CPQ package. So go to this URL. So this is the latest version, click on production. This link. What is the username, madam? This is my username. So in this org only I want to install right there. So that's why I want to give that username and give the password. Okay, so then click a login button. So I want to save this in my organizer extension. Yes. Okay. So here I will not give phone number, I don't want to register my phone number, I'll remain, maybe I'll do later. So now we are installing the CPQ package. So it is asking questions, madam. So this package you want to install only for salesforce admin profile, or all the users in your system, or any specific profiles, you can choose for which profiles you want to give access. Okay, so my requirement, I'll go for all the users. So anyone can use this in my org, all the users can use the CPQ package. Okay. Okay, then click on this, I acknowledge that I'm installing non salesforce application that is not authorized by distribution as part of salesforce application, no problem. Just click on install. Even if you want to see this is a package, right, madam. So in this packages, there are so many components in the background, you can pick a few components, you can see clearly. Okay, what are the things are there in this component in the package, there are so many objects, so many visual force pages, so many components, so many fields, so many lightning components. All these components are developed in CPQ package, madam. So because of all these components, so much of salesforce CPQ is automated in the CPQ. Because of all these things only, automatically created trigger contracts, code templates, like amendments, renewal opportunities, so much of functionality developed distributed company for automation of CPQ and so many things we can achieve in the CPQ. These are all components. Okay, you can see all these things. These are all will come after your package installation. Okay, so just click on install, install button. So yes, I want to give access this third party access to my salesforce or click on continue. So now your CPQ package will install in this organization. So where you can check after package installation, how you will know package is installed successfully or not, how you can check all those things is if this package is installed successfully, you will get one email confirmation email. And along with this, what you can do is you can go to the salesforce or here you can just type a installed packages. So here you will see packages installed successfully, you can see that all the packages information here. Okay, so because this is not a small thing, it will take around five to 10 minutes, because this is the there are so many components just now we have seen right, so much of components are there in this package. So it will take time to install this organization in your order. So meanwhile, we will discuss some other topics. Okay. So now we can go to this or this is the URL. Okay. So now, example, as you we have installed package successfully. Okay, package is installed successfully, then what you have to do after package installation, what are the first steps we have to do in the system? Okay, post package installation steps, what you have to do the steps after package installation in Salesforce. Okay. So first thing is, okay, so we have to enable calculation service calculator for all the calculations. I'll tell you, I will show you how to enable all these calculations, which is in the package. And second one is, we need to update CPQ layers, we need to assign CPQ layers to the profiles, which profiles wants to use CPQ functionality, right. So by default, now what you can see, if you go to the account object, if you just after seeing this message, just click a done button, then only it will install, it will take time. Okay. So if you see normally, if you go to the object manager, if you open account object, if you go to the page notes, you can see by default, these layers is given by Salesforce. So there is no like a CPQ layout now, correct? Not only this object, if you go to the other object product object. So in a part of the terminal layouts, you can see there is only one level normal product level. If you use this layouts, you cannot do CPQ calculations. Okay, so CPQ package having their own pages, their own fields, their own buttons, their own components, everything is brought in by CPQ. So that package is installed successfully, you will get all the CPQ layers for objects, okay, some important objects, which is required by CPQ. So actually, which objects are important for CPQs. So there are some objects and objects we are using for CPQ functionality, one is product. So this is this object also, we have separate fields and layers, CPQ layout, and account and opportunity and contract. But these Salesforce objects, instead of normal page layout, instead of default layout, okay, what we have to do is, we have to send CPQ layouts. So why CPQ layouts is, if you want to work on CPQ functionality, for example, assume I am Vara Prasad, right? So if I want to work on CPQ functionality, CPQ package, what I will do, I need to access CPQ things. So that's why, so for example, Vara profile is system administrator. So what I have to do, sir, for all this profile, who wants to work on Salesforce CPQ, for that profiles, so we have to assign CPQ layers. Everyone knows that how to assign CPQ page loads to the other profiles. Anyone knows how to assign page loads to the profiles, madam? How we can assign? Where we can go? How we can assign page loads to the profiles? If you go to the object, you can see there is a option. So which page layout you want to use for which profile, which page layout you want to use for which profile, we can see here, right? Currently, we have only one page layout for product object. That's why everyone can see the normal product layout. Okay, madam. For example, if I want to send two page layouts for one user, can we assign, madam, two page loads or three page loads for one user? Yes, we assign. How can I send more than one page load to the user profile? He wants to see two page layout. One is a product layout, one is CPQ product layout. He wants to see record types. Correct. What is the top? What we have, madam? If you want to assign more than one page layout, we should go for what, madam? Record type. That already we know in admin, right? Okay. So, but here also, if you want to use record types, if you want to use both page loads for admin profile, you can create one record type, a normal product record type or a CPQ product, like a CPQ product, something like that. Create two record types. In one record type, you can use product layout. In another record type, what you can do, madam? CPQ page layout, if you want. Okay. Anyway, I don't want to use this normal page layout. So, I want to work. I want to focus mainly on CPQ functionality now. So, what I have to do, madam? What is our profile now? System administrator. For this profile, which layout we'll assign? CPQ product layout. Okay. And still that is not installed. Once this package is installed, you will get, it will take time, 10 minutes. So, just I'm saying, okay, how you can assign page layouts to the profiles. So, this person is working on CPQ functionality. So, that's why I'm assigning CPQ layout. For example, there is one more profile called standard user. If he wants to work on CPQ functionality, what we can do, madam? Assign to the CPQ layouts. Otherwise, how we can see the CPQ fields layout and all those things, right? So, who wants to work on CPQ functionality? Who needs to configure products for all those profiles? You can use the CPQ layouts instead of normal layouts. Clear what I'm saying here till now? Understanding or not? Okay. This is the second step we have to do after package installation. And now important topic is, so we need to talk about product object, price book object, and price book entry object. I think everyone knows here who are joined their admin. So, what is the relationship between product price book and price book entry? Many to many relationship. What is many to many relationship? A product can have many prices. So, one product can have many prices. I'll explain once again because two or three people are new here. I'll take example. Okay. So, we know product and price book. All these are customer, standard objects, ma'am. Standard objects. What is standard object meaning, ma'am? Created by force.com. Created by sales force given by ma'am. If you create by using force.com, that is called custom. Already sales force is giving or you are creating these objects? We have not creating any product object. We created now. We created this product object and automatically this came. So, whatever sales force is providing, that is called standard. Whatever we can create, that is called custom. Not only object, either custom field, standard field, standard layout, custom layout, standard profile, custom profile, standard application, custom application. Understand, ma'am? Everything by default sales force provides, that is called standard. If we create, that is called custom. Clear everyone? This is product object. This is price book object. For example, I have a product here called Samsung laptop one, Samsung laptop two, Samsung laptop three. Okay, we have three products. So in a sales force, what is the first thing we have to do is whenever you create a product record in sales force, we have to assign default price or you can call it as a standard price. Whenever you create a product in a sales force, first thing what you have to do, we have to assign standard price for that product. That is mandatory. For example, I can give for this product price is $100. This product price is $200. This product price is $300. This is the standard price, ma'am. Okay. So based on the customer, based on the customer's region, country, state, this will change. Okay, how it will change, we'll discuss so this is product. So product is nothing but a product name, product code, which type of product. Okay. Software, hardware, family, all those things come under product object. So why we'll go for price book. Okay. For example, if I want to sell my products only in a one place, only in India, then you don't need to create a multiple price books. You can create a only one price book already by default is their standard price book. You can use it. You can assign all these products to the one price book. You can sell it in only one place, but customer is selling these products in a different, different countries. So then what we can do, you should go for different, different price books, bring their customers. I'll go for India price book for the USA customer. I can get a different price book where Japan customers, I can get a different price. And one more thing is product price is not fixed in all the places. Correct me. So based on the country, based on the taxes in their country, GSTs and all those things, product price will change. Okay. So for example, if I want to sell this Samsung laptop, one product in all these three countries. So what I have to do, I have to link this product to the, all the price books, right? Like this, you can link that. So similarly, I want to sell this one also in all the three countries. Same for this. I want to sell three products in all the countries. Same. Now, if you observe one product is having how many price books? Three price books. Multiple. Simple. I'm giving three price books. You can get a number of price books. Understand? Similarly, one price book is having how many products? Multiple. So this is called many to many relationships in a sales force. One product can have a multiple price books. One product you can sell in multiple countries. Similarly, one country you can send multiple products. This is called many to many relationship in a sales force. So normally we cannot create many to many relationship in a sales force between the two objects directly. That is not possible. You cannot link like this. If you want to link a product and price book. So what we have to do is? Junction object. We have to create a junction object in a sales force. Here in this case, what is the junction object name is? What's madam? Price book. Price book entry. So from the price book entry, we have a relationship to which one product in the price book entry to price book. Also, we have a relationship. This is called child object or junction object in the price book entry. What we can choose here now? You can choose the what manner. What you can choose now. Which product? For which country where you want to sell India customers? I'll choose an India price. What is the default price is there? Madam here $100 for India customers. You want to the same price or you want to change here? I will use the same price for India customers. How much price I'm giving for India customers? If I choose for India customers, what is the price for the Samsung laptop one? $100 so this is called what manner list price. Same product example, same Samsung laptop one. I want to. Sell in USA what I have to do when I have to choose the US price book. But if you say there is a huge demand, I'll make it a $120. Same product based on the country price is changing, madam. Yes or no? So because based on what is the use of price book is generally by the way, we will create a multiple price books is if you want to differentiate price for your product based on the place, region, country, then only you can go for multiple price books. If you want to fix price for the product all over the countries, no need to create all these price books. One price book is enough. Okay, same way. If I want to create a Samsung laptop two for India customers, I will use a $200 same some Samsung laptop two. For USA customers, I want to give $250. Understand madam, what you're observing here now. So one product Samsung laptop one is having multiple price books. Samsung laptop one is there in India also US also. Same way, India having two multiple products, laptop one also there, laptop two also there. So like this, if you want to link one product to multiple price books, one price book to multiple products. What is the junction up to here, madam? Price book entry. Price book entry. It's clear what I'm saying? Chandra, you are following what I'm saying? Chandra, Rishikesh, Krithika, Krishnamurthy. Are you clear, madam? Mainly Krithika, Krishnamurthy, and Chandra, and Rishikesh, you people only. Because other people already joined admin. They know Salesforce. Yeah, clear, sir. So what product and price book is this? These are all standard objects in Salesforce. One product can have multiple price books. One price book can have multiple products. So whenever we can create a product in Salesforce, we should assign a standard price. But this price is change. You can change at the time of linking product and pricing. If you want to link this one to this product and price book, where we can connect these two objects in the price book entry object, we can connect both objects. That's why we can call this junction object or child object. This is having a relationship to product. This is having a relationship to the price book. Choose product, price book, and give the price. This is the relationship between product, price book, and price book entry. This is the main thing. If you want to create products in Salesforce CPQ, you should understand the configuration of products, how we have to configure. Right, so we'll see CPQ package installed or not. You are getting email, right, ma'am? So your package is installed successfully. Where you can check now? Package installed successfully or not? Refresh. Refresh. In the installed packages, you can see that. Right, so this is, here you can see the package, your CPQ package, okay? So this is one part, we'll do one thing, we'll stop it.",
