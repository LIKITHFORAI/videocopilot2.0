  "text": "Good morning, everybody. Morning, morning. Good morning. We'll see if everybody else can make their way to this meeting. Yes, let me, um, so I'm looking, I know some stuff's going on with crisis and let me check with Dornay. It looks like Beth Tabakni could be here, but let me check with Dornay. There's a lot, as you know, a lot of stuff going on in the crisis center. Right. Yeah, let's see. Dornay, let me ask her, will she make it? Good morning, Rishon. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. Hi. Are we in this right meeting? Uh, there was two on the calendar. Lord. It did the, I marked one of them. Please decline this meeting invite. I don't know if it. Yeah, but I did that. No, no, no. So I did that to that one, but this is a different one. This is the new one. So I'm hoping that it came across to everyone. Okay. I'm sorry. We've had, we updated our servers and that it just messed everything up in Teams. Okay. Okay. Do you see the, do you? I'm, I'm checking with. Are you able to see two, Summer? Say that again. At all on your calendar? Are you able to see two on your calendar, two meetings? Oh yeah. One says, please decline this meeting invite. However, the only problem with the other one is because of the issues with our server, I can't even get into that meeting to tell people to come to this one. So give me a second. So the, the one that says, please decline, I declined that. That's not on the calendar. There's two on the calendar. Yeah. That's two on the calendar right now. Proud that it's the same and it doesn't say please decline. Okay. Cause it only shows two. Let me show you what mine shows. Cause I don't know how to fix that at this point. Cause I can't get it in. Let me, let me see if I can. I only have these two showing on my calendar. So there's a third one. Yeah. There's a third one. Okay. Yeah. Then the, unfortunately I don't, I don't even know how to address that to get them into this room. I can ping them individually or I can request them to join. Let me see if I can. Yeah. Let me see if I can join this and see if anybody's there. Where's everybody else from the County though? That's what I'm messaging Dornay. She said, Beth is supposed to be here. Beth Tabaknik. I'm just saying, I'm going to add her in. Let's see, maybe she's in red. I know a lot of stuff is going on. So I told Dornay, please come. Let me see. Let me get Beth and Dornay. Hello, Beth. How you doing? Good morning. Good morning. Yeah, I jumped over and looked and there's like five people over there. Oh, okay. And Rashaun jumped over there too. So, maybe in the new invites, the correct ones, you should put like the word new or something like that or update it. I put in the invite, please use this meeting invite, but I'm pretty sure nobody scrolled down to that part. Yeah, it doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't register. It doesn't register. No, I mean, I don't think, I don't think they did either. Yeah, I was just thinking maybe it would be obvious if you change the title. Maybe so. Okay. Yeah, that's kind of wild. I mean, I just opened both of them and I don't see the part where you said please use this one or whatever. Oh, I saw that in bold. I feel like I saw that. You put it in bold, right? I thought I saw that last night. Yeah, I thought I did too, but maybe. You know, every time I make an update, it'll say, it'll give me like an error in terms of like the editing. And I promise I had to like close my laptop and walk away for a while because every edit I was doing, it would literally give me an error and revert. And then it was adding like the please decline to the wrong meetings. And I was just like, oh my gosh, it would get to the last three days to become a hot mess, which is not, you know, unfortunately, like I said, I can't get into the old, I can't even get into the old meetings to say, hey, come join us in this new meeting. I can do that part for you. Please. Just a couple of minutes in the beginning of each meeting. I'll jump over to the other one and redirect people for a couple of minutes. Thank you. Thank you, Dernay and Beth. Thanks. There was some technical difficulties, so we got it. Absolutely. Thank you. I apologize for that. Okay. So they're coming. They're coming. They're coming. Let's see. Marcy is the one. Request to join. Yeah. So I went to get people from the other one. I appreciate that. Aziz on your side, Summer, is in that other meeting, but I don't think he's online because he didn't. Osamu? Okay. Yes. He's in the other one, but I don't think he, I think he just locked in. I don't think he's there. But I think everybody's here. Beth? Yes, Beth is here. Dernay is too. And Marcy. Okay. Okay. And I think while we're here, let's just work on some technical things. I think Summer, this isn't the, oh, yeah, this isn't the only one that got duplicated. Oh, wow. Let me see. All the others are duplicated too. They don't say please don't join this meeting invite? No, no. Oh my goodness. You know, okay. Yeah. Not a problem. That is going to be, you know, I apologize that the last few days that this is getting wonky. However, nothing got messed up until our servers got replaced over this weekend. I can't even get into the meetings on Monday. So I can't cancel the old meetings because I can't get into them. However, I will, Jamila, if you have any time this afternoon, if you can carve out like 30 minutes to go through the meetings with me, I'll try to get it cleaned up as quickly as possible. Exactly. Because there's some cancellations. There's some cancellations and I combined some. Okay. So yeah, just some, let me, yeah, this afternoon, let me see how, let me see what's going on this afternoon. Yeah. And it's funny because it looked like they all popped up today because they weren't there yesterday. No, they were not there last night. I was just going to say. Yep. So after the PATH meeting at 345, does that sound good? We can do that after that. Is that good? Absolutely. I will make myself available. Yeah. And then we know that the one o'clock will be. One o'clock. CAS is a combination of crisis and CASS. That's a combination. Today? Today. Yes. That's at 1300. Let's do this. Let's do this. I am, send an email and then we'll let them know that we're having some teams difficulty and we'll call them into the one o'clock. Okay. I can do that. We'll call people into the right meeting. Okay. Once we get there. Okay. We'll do that. Yes. While we try to work it out. The one tomorrow is also duplicated. Oh, they all are. All of them are. I'm pretty sure at this point, they're all duplicated. I will work with you all to try to get this cleaned up and get this communicated as clearly as possible. That's very interesting because the one tomorrow at nine is duplicated and the one on Friday but the one tomorrow at two isn't. Yes. Only the one tomorrow at nine is duplicated. Let me show you what it looks like on my end because I just want to show you guys what it looks like on my end because this is what it shows. All of the ones that I couldn't get into are now listed with please decline this meeting link and replaced with the new ones because I have access to those. Aside from that, there's not a third one. It seems it's also showing that I have multiple profiles at this point. We'll send out something to the staff. Okay. Thank you. We'll get this right away. Thank you. Sorry again for the technical difficulty guys, Beth, Dornay, Mercy. You guys, this is not the first rodeo so we can get into it. We really just want to know for this program mobile crisis, just tell us a little bit about the program, how you get your referral, how you do the work. I'm thinking mobile crisis is something that's in the community so it's not situated in an office, right? Are you with the mobile van or you just call yourself mobile because you go in the community? If you give us a spiel about the program. Yeah, we're mobile crisis outreach team so we're separate from mobile health, which you might also be reviewing. Dornay, do you want me to jump in? So we have- Yeah, go ahead. So really just really quickly, just to give a quick, so crisis center is all these things. So CAAS, mobile crisis, and regular crisis center, all are under Beth at- Oh, and residential crisis services. All of that is crisis center, crisis center staff, it's all under Beth, but each of them do a different function. So she'll tell you what this function does. Go ahead, Beth. Yeah, and that's why we were saying the process for CAS and our walk-in assessments is very similar. So we did think it would be, we had mentioned we thought it might be time efficient to combine those two, and we'll walk through that this afternoon. But mobile crisis is a little bit different, and that's why I think it's helpful to have Marcy here because she's a very experienced therapist and she's part of these processes every day. She's actually one of our most frequently assigned MCOT therapists, so she'll be a good resource to have with this. So what happens is we have requests from the community or from service providers or from our first responder partners that come through our main crisis lines, and they'll call and request when a mobile crisis outreach team respond to a location in the community. We write up some information in a triage form, which is then shared with the team, and the team is dispatched to the location. So in addition to having teams located here on site at the crisis center, we also have two teams that are regionally based. We have a team at 8818 Georgia Avenue, or that's a team that dispatches out of 8818 Georgia Avenue and a team that dispatches out of 12900 Middlebrook. So they're not, the teams are, you know, able to dispatch from several different locations. But we take the information, write a triage log, forward it to the team that will be responding, and then when the team will go out and do their assessment, when the team returns to the office, they'll complete their next-gen documentation, their comp assessment, if they were able to see the client. In some of these situations, you know, there's a relatively high frequency of situations where we might respond, the client will not be there, or, you know, it will be called off before we respond, so those don't result in a full comp assessment or haven't historically resulted in a full comp assessment. But we do have, you know, anytime we do, we are able to make contact with a client and complete an assessment, we'll do a comp assessment and scan any affiliated paperwork into next-gen. So if we write an emergency evaluation petition, which is the court order to have someone transport to the hospital for further evaluation, we'll scan that documentation in as part of the client's record. Yes, real quickly, for the work that's done in the field, which is, you know, for the mobile, these are all paper documents that are completed? These are forms? Yeah, well, the request form, the triage form, is a shared form, and it's a form that's in our shared drive that we complete online and then email to the teams. We do print it out, but it's also emailed to the team so they can receive it electronically, as well as having a hard copy of the request form, which gets scanned into the record. And then the other documents, I'm sorry, go ahead. One second. So with that form, that's something for your internal team when they're going out? So about the situation, about the referral, what is going on, those things. Can you guys share with me any one of these forms that you guys have, like all of this documentation? And these, the team goes with this form. Is it electronic or is it paper? We have it both. So when the staff complete the form on the shared drive, they email the forms to the team that will be responding. So for example, if we take the call in Rockville, the staff will complete the form, email the form to the Silver Spring team, for example, so that the Silver Spring team has that form available. We also do print out the form and have a hard copy of the form as well. You look like you might have some follow-up questions. I do, but it's okay. Keep going. Yeah, no, it's not the most efficient. It's difficult for us to figure out how to have something that everyone can see. It's just like with stabilization we talked about yesterday, right? That everyone can see in real time when a referral comes in and know who's supposed to respond and what team and what office. So if anything about this process could do any of that, we would love that. So it's a team triage thing. So I think one of the things that is unique to your work, right, is that it's not a one-off thing, right? It's a group of people that are in the process of the work, right? And the group need to be notified of situations that are happening, right? Chris let us kind of put that our thinking caps on on how to provide this kind of functionality. But this is one of those situations where it's not a, oh, I'm one person, I give it to another person. This is actually group teaming work that needs to go out for crisis. Yeah, does everybody have mobile devices that can access the internet all the time? We do have laptops assigned to the mobile crisis teams. Yes, and it will be. They also have cell phones. Yeah. And if we need, we will provide iPads. So I'm answering Chris, yes. Because if it's a tech that is going to stop us, that's not going to happen. Yeah, just this is an aside, maybe not relevant to this conversation, but one of the pieces of feedback we get frequently is that, you know, NextGen has been historically very difficult to read in the field because of the way that it's set up on, you know, on the laptop. It's just, you know, it's just not user-friendly in terms of being, you know, mobile and trying to read through the different, you know, the different stages of the documentation. So we look forward to hopefully some improvements there, you know, so that we can, you know, it's a little bit more, it's a little bit more conducive to reading on the go. So. So, but yes, the forms are being emailed to the staff who are being dispatched, as well as to the supervisory team. So the supervisory team is also reviewing the requests that are coming in, and those are looped into the different, the different calls the teams are responding to. So it is, it is very much a group effort, or it's a group, it requires group communication as part of the response. And then, like I said, we complete the assessment in the community. We're not, Marcy can jump in if there's anything practical she wants to bring up in regards to this. But, you know, to the best of my knowledge, I don't believe anyone's actually, you know, typing on the computer at the point they're talking to clients in the community. That's just not practical. So the rest of the documentation is completed in the aftermath of, in the, you know, after the team returns to the office, or is completed with a call. Just to put a caveat in there, our chief, and the whole purpose of them having all the laptops and all that in the car, but so that in between calls, when they were waiting, when they were sitting, they could start doing their paperwork, or the other person drove the car. And that is the chief's expectation, that some of this work is done in the field, and not all held until they get back to the office. Just want to put that out there for everyone to understand. Yeah. And regarding the assessment, are different team members filling out different parts of the same assessment, or is everybody just filling out their own form? Well, that's an interesting point. So, it's not, it's not a smooth ideal process. So, one of the things that we've struggled with, because we would love to do some things electronically, but one of the things that we, or we'd love to, to create a team, to have the mobile crisis triage form as a team's form. But one of the challenges of that is that you have some information that's collected on the front end, and then some information that's, that's added on the back end. So, so the, the, the form, it's not, we haven't been able to figure out a way to create a team's form document that would be able to allow for collecting the information smoothly. The other, the other component of this, which is very complicated, is that we have these state reporting requirements for all of our mobile crisis calls. The state has a workbook, of like 95 data points that we're required to submit. Very similar to what we sent you yesterday, yep. It's what you guys saw yesterday for stabilization, but mobile crisis is even more. So, Beth can drop the link to that in this chat or email to you, like I did yesterday, for stabilization. Yeah, it's, it's the same data points, but it's not cleanly captured from any one document. So, we have, we've hired someone to help us compile the data so that we can report it to the state, because right now that really is a full-time job for being able to gather the needed, the required data points from each different, from each different platform. So, we have some data points that are on the triage, we have some data points that are in NextGen. We also use a, and we've been using, I think, Dr. Nembhard, I think we've discussed this at one point, where we've been using an Excel spreadsheet to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, enter some information in real time that our staff have immediate access to that also has some data points that we can't cleanly extract from NextGen, that we haven't historically been able to cleanly extract from NextGen, like law enforcement accompaniment, which is a big one for the state, you know. So, we, there's not a way of, of gathering that information or report, gathering that report from NextGen, so we have to have the separate document that talks about whether we've taken law enforcement, you know, and that, whether law enforcement was utilized, you know, at what stage they were utilized during the call and things like that, that just aren't capturable in NextGen at this point. And that's, Chris, that's our individualized involved parties that we were talking about before, and that's across the board for all programs. You have to, you have to explicitly name people involved in the actual activity and not in the notes. You'd be able to pull that out. So, I wanted to kind of center that again, Chris, because I know it came up in multiple programs, but that's something we have to report on. The, the, if you can send me all the forms and the data points that you need. I already started the folder for stabilization, Dornay, so I already put that SOP in there, in the SOP folder for stabilization. I'll create one for this one. I'll put the documentation there, but anything that you guys have, the templates, anything that you use externally, let us know. The difficulty you're mentioning in some of the data is that some is you can collect it in the field, some you collect during the process, some you assess after the process. Right, so that's that's what the the that's a dynamic of the activity that is happening and then you need all these data points to be reported, right? Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry Beth, keep going. Marcy, is there anything that you would want to add while I'm gathering this workbook and putting the workbook in here? Is there anything you would want to add in terms of the process that we haven't spoken to? I don't think so. But everything is in the field normally on paper or sorry Teams form or a spreadsheet and then it's entered in NextGen. Would you guys be able to show us where like a test client where you enter the templates you use to enter the information in NextGen? Go ahead Dornan, sorry. No and you asked are there different people documenting, they are documenting different things like our peers will be doing SBIRT, which falls under assessment, and the therapist will be doing the, you know, COMPASSESS, so everyone will have a different piece that will somehow need to be attached and with the same encounter, with the same, like we talked about yesterday, it's not really an appointment, it's more of an encounter, like a rolling thing. Right, so all these activities within that encounter, right? Correct. So this is happening at this in, we go out, these are the things that are happening. Are all those, are all those individual service billable or just the encounter itself is billable for the activity? Yes. No. So what's billable is the actual face-to-face encounter and any of the follow-up calls that the peers make after the mobile crisis outreach. Those are the only things that are billable. So the face-to-face encounter, meaning whoever is on site that's talking to the customer? Yes. Okay, so whether it's the... Right, so us driving there, the pre-work, the after work, we don't get paid for that, we only get paid for the amount of assessment time in face-to-face with the client, with the whatever client. Beth, can you, does it count if you talk to the family member on scene? That part I don't remember. Like if we get there and then we talk to the mother because the client's now gone. Oh no, I don't think so. Yeah, I think it's just the client. Yeah, it's just the client. Yeah, it's just the client. Yeah, it's direct contact with the client. So here's my question and I need Chris's help with this. So this is where the clinical space gets complicated because it's not very flexible for episodes, right? So an episode is that I'm going to a mobile crisis. In that crisis, there are billable activities and non-billable activities. And I could be performing both of those things, right? I could be doing the intake, not billable. And I also could be doing an assessment with a customer, billable, right? I'm trying to figure out like how flexible is Dr. Cloud in having that activity logged, right? The crisis log and all these different instances as just different detailed activities within that episode, right? And then we can decide, okay, this is billable, this is not billable. This is, right? Instead of overshadowing the billing when I'm actually in crisis, like I don't want to think about billing, right? Chris, help me out here. I don't know if I'm being... Well, just to simplify it, I mean, you're talking about an episode of care, which involves beginning of the enrollment, getting into the program, starting to receive services, and then going through all the services that are received, and then a discharge or termination of the services being provided in that program, right? So we would use admission and discharge to indicate the beginning of the episode of care and the end of the episode of care. And within there, we would have encounters that are created, and there would be different visit types or types of services that are provided that we're identifying as we're documenting them. And those would each be an encounter, and those can be marked at the outset or by the template as billable or not billable. And then, or if they can mark them as billable, if they need to change that, they could change that status of that encounter. But everything's going to be, this is the type of thing we're doing with this person right now, and labeling it as such, and then completing the notes that are needed for that aspect of the service, and then finishing those notes, and then saying, okay, now we're going to document this part of the crisis episode, and that may or may not be a different encounter. So it just depends on, you know, how you would categorize the services and how you want to document them and break them out, you know what I mean? So it's just classifying the services that are being provided in those encounters, and that's how you can show the entire episode of care from admission to discharge and the encounters in between that document that. Okay. Do you have any grouping function? I mean, it's not group therapy, so is there any group work function in Dr. Cloud? What do you mean? So it's teaming work, not just individual. So how would I put this? Well everyone is going to have access to the client and the document either in an existing encounter or a new encounter. Right, but if I wanted to log the actual call, so the call would be a bed, right? The crisis is a bed, and then anything that happens in and around that bed is one instance of a crisis, and they're a group of individuals that have access to that instance. I think I'm trying to combine the group work, intake, expectation, and notification with a call out, because when a crisis comes in, it's for a team of people. So when the initial call comes in, there needs to be documentation of the call, and then the response needs to be documented as well, right, from all the team members that are doing the different parts of the response. Right, right, and we keep it in that. We would keep it in that kind of grouping. That's the idea, because I'm trying to, the solution for them will not just be that mobile piece. There's also the management before that needs to happen. My apologies. Dr. Nembhard and Dornay, I'm going to have to step away for a moment, so I'll leave this in Dornay's capable hands. I'll be right back. Sure. But it's almost like a group work kind of thing that's combining an intake for a group instead of just one person you're sending it to, like triage boarding. It's tough, right, Chris, because we're user-based. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's possible to do. It's just understanding who's doing what and what that should look like for everybody in there. You know what I mean? Right. Right. Right. So my barrier was the exact thing that Ryan said. It's user-based, so it's individual. This group would have to be its own user. This group? What do you mean? Right. I mean, the mobile crisis would have to be it's a user for this to work. And honestly, that's how it is now, like mobile crisis team is its own calendar, its own events, and so everyone has access to that calendar, and they put everyone that they see, right, because there are times that we have seven teams all out seeing different people at the same time, and they put that on the calendar to denote that they've seen somebody, right? But they're all one person as mobile crisis team so that they can utilize one area to see all the different calls. And there could be cases where the same team member is scheduling an appointment for the same client, or different team members are scheduling the appointment for the same client. Is that something that happens? No. No. There's going to be one appointment, and then within that, there can be multiple people entering. But a one appointment. Yes. Unless something happens later where we have to do something, like if another team has to go back out for another reason, we'd have another appointment for that. Like, each time we go out, we do appointments. It's a group calendar schedule, Chris. Okay. So, whoever has access to that group, it's one calendar, one appointment. Yeah, I don't think that's a problem. Because I have, you know, we have the ability to show a calendar based on a program, and who's assigned to that program. But then, even in that, the person has an individual calendar, right? Not... Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so you can assign multiple providers to an appointment, and you can have, you know, multiple appointments for a provider, or for multiple providers. I'm not sure. I'm not sure I understand. No, it's literally one. I think what they have is the opposite of what normally happens, right? It's a group calendar, and it's eight hours in the day, right? So, you see, you've got eight slots, right? And I, that have access to this group, I know, as a team, I can put only one person per slot in there, client per slot. The doctor assignment is later. It's not based on the doctor's calendar. It's based on the group calendar. Hmm. Yeah. So, why was it, why is it set up that way? Is that, was that the ideal, or is that because of the way you had to do it in NextGen, or? It was the way we had to do it in NextGen. There was no way for us to keep track of everyone, to be able to see, like, mobile crisis, right? It was one calendar so that everyone had access to it. We're 24-7, 365. We never close, right? So, if there wasn't, like, our front desk staff is there, right? They're putting in, sometimes, right, the walk-in information. They're putting in a mobile crisis, you know, if the therapist is busy and doesn't have time to put the appointment in. They're also in the window, right? So, we had one, we have one calendar for walk-ins. We have one calendar for mobile crisis. Part of that was that we needed to be able to keep data and track of how many of everything we were doing. How many walk-ins versus how many mobile crisis we were doing. Some of it was also NextGen functionality that nobody could think of a way that we all could have access to, you know, one place. I can't explain it, but yes. Okay, yeah, I see. I mean, is it possible to see that scheduling process that you have now in NextGen so we can kind of review that? I mean, I can show you. Yes, please. But it's a combination of NextGen and a spreadsheet, right, Dornay? Yes. So, I am trying to make sure that, well, maybe I just need to understand what. So, the program has a set of folks working for the program, and it registers services. But some of these services are performed by a group of the folks that you're calling this team. And it's that team. Now, individually, everybody that belongs to the program, individually, everybody can have their own schedule, right? Am I saying that right? Everybody can have their own separate schedule, but there are groups of people that form this crisis team, and this crisis team has to have its own schedule. Is that what we're talking about? So, yes and no, because literally everybody in the crisis center does everything. So, on any given day, Marcy may be Tuesday on mobile crisis. Wednesday, she's seeing crisis center walk-ins. And, you know, the next day, she's doing residential crisis services, right? Everyone does everything that falls under the crisis center. So, they need access to all the things that can't just be their personal calendar. Because maybe in your system that would work, but in the system we have now, that didn't work because everybody couldn't see everyone's personal calendars, right? So, we had to have one uniform program-by-program calendar to be able to see who was where and what was going on. And it's hard to explain. If you've never been to the crisis center and seen how it works and the layers, right, Marcy? It's hard to explain all the things that happen or could happen with one person throughout a day. Well, I'm just trying to draw a distinction between a team calendar, which it seems what you just said implies that the team members are flexible. So, today I can, right, the team members can be flexible, but the schedule that you're going to maybe slot somebody into will belong to the team, belong to a team. And you may or may not know who the team members will be at any given time. Right, because I think the thing you said about their personal calendars, that is a no-go. Okay, so no personal calendars. We don't need personal calendars. So, the whole thing is just based on team calendars where the team members are dynamic. Yes. Correct. And that's what you need. That's why you need everybody to have access to all the calendars, because they can find themselves in any given team at any given time. Correct. Right, Marcy? Yeah, so do you want me to show you what it looks like? All right, bear with me. I'm not the most tech savvy. Share. Screen. Can you see that calendar? Yes. Okay, so you can see over here, that's our crisis center calendar. So, that's where all of our appointments go for walk-ins and our mobile crisis. And then this is RCS, our residential crisis services. And then I also have access to our psychiatrist calendar in case I need to make appointments for him. And then here's our CAS calendar. And then here's another, our nurse practitioner. So, I have access to all of those calendars. I typically, myself, only use the crisis center calendar because I don't do RCS or CAS. So, any appointment I make is going to be over here. Whether it's, you know, I've seen a walk-in or I've been at a mobile crisis. And what's the reason that's tracked on the schedule? If it's happening in real time, is that an accounting of your time? Or is that because you have scheduled things that are going to be happening that you want to be aware of? I think it's to keep track of the work that we're doing. Okay. Otherwise, I don't think we have any other way to capture it. And I think, I think I wanted to make that distinction and I wasn't being clear earlier, Chris. I think these schedules are being used for activities, not as real things, right? It's a thing I can count later. Yeah, it's something you have to do because that's how you can do it in the next year. Exactly, exactly. But I think Marcy probably already saw the customer, right, in the field. Right, right. It's kind of silly that now you come in, you have to do a schedule for something you already did. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't think that a better utilization here or view would be a dashboard that shows all the potential crisis clients to all of the crisis team members. And then they can just go into the chart of that individual who's being served at this moment in time and then document what they need to for that person. And so everyone would be able to see that? Yes. Yes. Yeah, I like that. Instead of having this scheduling thing in our heads of how to document stuff, you just document your activity, right? You might face-to-face, happened on this day and this time. You wouldn't need to do a schedule to fake the time because it's also faking the time because it's after the fact anyway. Yeah. Right. That makes sense. So that's where I'm trying to shift how we are doing the work. But now when Chris mentioned the client as the triage board indicator, Dornay, like, okay, now I get what Chris is probably saying, right? So the client is the crisis, right? In that instance, whoever is doing anything with that customer put it inside that patient record, right? And you can see it across your dashboard. Like, okay, here are the crisis that we have in the field. Here it is. This is client A in Rockville, client B in whatever, right? Now what we would need is a team member. or to do their first log, right? So this is what I was asking before. For a program like this that need to have an indicator, worker A, worker B, worker C, they're on client A in Rockville, right? Is there a quick way for me to, for Dornay to know like, oh, I've got five workers on this customer there. It's not intake, it's not anything, it's like, oh, I picked up the call. Here are my five workers, I picked up the call. Chris, anything like that? You're not starting an intake or anything, you're actually doing the assignment. Yeah, I mean, it is possible, just what needs to be viewed in that view, I guess, is what we'd need to determine. Okay, because then they can log their activities in the instance anyway, but the actual people on the call, the people going into the field, it would be nice to know. Client A in Rockville, I've got five workers that picked up that client, and five workers are in that site. We'll, we will, Dornay, we will try to come up with the best solution for this, for July, because I really don't think it, we'll have to talk to Dr. Clancy. I don't think giving you back what you have now is helpful. No, we don't want back what we have now. Yes, the thing is that the first instance of this is going to be data for data, right? So it's like, oh, the data that's in NextGen, right? So we're not really looking at functionality, but I think this is one of those spaces that we have to probably create something different. Oh, absolutely, and nothing, I will tell you the majority of the things that we do are hand counts. They are not taken from NextGen. It's a hand count. We have a zillion spreadsheets, and Marcy can attest to that. Okay, okay. Chris, Ryan, can we log this? That list is getting long, but I have to prioritize that list. As one of those where go live for them probably means a partial new bill. I'm saying partial, Dornay, because I kind of want to see what I can get done for July and then just do added functionality after, right? Because we're in a very tight timeframe. But I don't know if a million spreadsheets and what you have now is going to be the same thing for DrCloud, but it could be two spreadsheets and a new function, right? And then we can do something. Right, so yeah, the issue is, you'll see this, we have to do reporting every month to the state down to the client level per mobile crisis. And of the 90 data sets, we only actually collect about 20 because we don't have the ability to get the rest of them. And the state asks us every week, sorry, every month we meet with them when our new system is starting because we can't keep giving them partial data. So that's why it's a bit of a- I think what I'm trying to say is I'm going to get you close to getting all that. Right, I get you. It'll probably, I'm sorry, in DrCloud, it'll probably be a phasing process, right? Like, we'll go, okay, July, we can get at least 80%. Then after that, we can get another 10, another 10. Let me, give me the documentation, all the paperwork you have, the DrCloud team. Let's talk about this. Is this the same book you gave me yesterday? Or is this different? Because I pulled that book already. Is this the same book? It's the same, oh, sorry. That's stabilization. So for this, for Mobile Crisis, is it the same book? I can hear you, Dornay, I can hear you. Oh, I don't know, I'm sorry. I thought I opened a new book. Did I open the wrong book? No, it's the same one. But they're all mixed in together. Oh, in that one document. Yes. I see, okay, no problem, no problem. I'll do that. Ryan, Chris, is this something we could investigate a little bit? Yeah, actually, Neil's maintaining the list that we're going to review with you next week, Dr. Numbard. So Neil, please add this to the list. And we've got a scope document, right, Dr. Numbard? We're thinking like you are, what can we do for June Go Live that's absolutely required versus what's on the roadmap that we'll do after Go Live. But let's continue the discussion on this. I'll internally kind of brainstorm it with the team, and then we'll come back to you with some thoughts. Okay, sure. So, Dornay, let's finish your process. If you have a workflow for me, like a write-up, a graphic, anything, even if it's narrative, we do this, then we do this, then we do this, then we do this, please. Those are the most helpful. Sure. Where this is concerned. And I know the state reporting, if you can give me that. Like, okay, this is the report that we need for the state monthly. But okay, you can continue, Marci, sorry, keep going. Well, I don't know, what else did you want to see? Like, do you want me creating an appointment? Yeah, so can I pull like an old one? Do a test, if you do test, Google test, there'll be a test client that you can pick. Okay. Like test is the last name? Yes, and first name, I believe. Let's just see what comes up. Okay. I was going to say that you could do adult, adult male, adult female, test, test, right? There's a lot. Well, I'm pulling up one we've already done, I guess. Oh, okay, okay. Let's see. Just test, test. A crisis center, so I don't know. Okay, let's see, what comes up in there? What I would do is I would call, and that's okay, so direct you to someone. This is none that are crisis center ones. They should be able to, yes. Okay, all righty, bye-bye. Yeah, I'm not sure how to find one that's going to have one of our mobile crisis. I mean, I guess I can, if you want me to just create one and go through my process. Okay. Yeah, just do a blank, we'll just type in like test. Okay, so I'm just going to first create the appointment. And then I'm going to create a new one. Okay. And then I'm going to create a new one. Okay. And then I'm going to create a new one. Okay. And then I'm going to create a new one. Okay. And all of ours are going to be diagnostic evaluation and the service location, mobile crisis. Give me one second, I need to answer this. And then I'm going to. Marty. Okay. And we have to always fill all this stuff out even if we don't have it. So that creates the appointment and then I have to check them in before I do any documentation. Okay. Marcy, do you always have the information for the customer, a full information for the patient? Because I know with the work that you guys do, you often don't have that. Yeah, that's a good question. We don't always have it. So like almost always, we don't have the social security numbers. So we just put in, you know, and sometimes we don't have the address because we're going out to see somebody that's like at the corner of such and such. So we might just put in our address or we just kind of make one up. But it would be nice to know where you actually were. Yeah. I mean, we'll have that, you know, probably in the narrative somewhere and we always scan the mobile crisis team requests. So it will be in there somewhere. Okay, but not explicitly. Okay. Correct. But it should be like, we were on the corner of 7th Street and 16th Street. Right, right. You know, right hand side. Right. But we, so there's no ability to do that in this thing, that connection. There's no way to do that. Because I also needed for, or coordinated care with our homeless services outreach. Team. I have to put my name. And this is the part where we add the insurance, which I have no idea why we do this. I guess it's related to the billing. I just do what I'm told. Yes, it's related to the billing. Okay, thank you. Okay. Okay, then we go into EHR and this is where I'm going to start the documentation. And the first thing we do is the program enrollment. I'm not sure what this is for either. Yeah, remember it started like a couple of years ago. But this is how we distinguish. So this was a mobile crisis call and not just a crisis center walk-in. And then we do, so that all of ours are going to be, for mobile crisis, it's all going to be an intake. And we choose behavioral health and intake no medical services. And then up pops all the screens that we're going to have to fill out. So here is what we, we just type in what the call was about. So, the police called to request us to respond to this location for this reason. That's not going to go in there. And then we have social history. For our mobile crisis calls, a lot of this information we're not going to have. So a lot of us are just typing like, unable to obtain this information or wasn't able to collect for whatever reason. Their behavioral health history is in our next screen, which we may or may not know. Some of the information we might get from family members and we will fill in as much as we can in this screen. Marcy, is there any way to bypass the whole flow? So I think, yeah, I will say for some other ones where maybe we go out and we don't really see the client, but maybe we've spoken to them on the phone, we might still just do like the concern screen and then the final screen, which is like the outcome and not do the other screens in between. So that is, we're not required to do everything in terms of what NextGen requires us to do. And this functional one, we don't do for mobile crisis. I don't know what that is for, honestly. So there's a lot of repetition in this, but our most important screens are, well, this final one really, the interpretive summary down here, because this kind of wraps everything up together, like why we were called out, like what their mental status was, what was the outcome? And then we generate a document, which, let's just say like tomorrow somebody wanted to see what happened on this call. Most likely what they're gonna come back to is look at the comp assessment, because that's gonna have all of the documentation in there. So I'm kind of going through this quickly and you can't really see what's in there because I didn't type anything. So I don't know what's helpful for you to know more about. That's, this is good. So, but there's no place to say, crisis call yesterday with the client Dorney Hill. Here's everything that happened in that. It will be in that. Call from beginning to end. Yeah. Is that only in the comp assessment? It really would be in the comp assessment. And is there only one person filling it out or how many, only one person filling it out? Yes, it's one person. Like there might be two therapists that go out there, but there's one person doing all the documentation. But it's two therapists that probably talking to the customer. Correct. One is kind of like the lead and the other one is kind of, you know, filling in as needed or, you know. Other people on the scene or. Right. They might be, exactly. Looking up the history. But none of that work is documented anywhere. So what they might like, if my partner maybe got some relevant information from a family member, they would share it with me and then I would still document it in here. We generally haven't been doing like a separate place for them to document that. Like, I will just say like, you know, coworker Sally spoke with mother and mother reported this. Okay. Which technically is not the appropriate way to document. Of course not. We know that's not, it's not. Yeah. We know. Yeah. We know, right? That's why if it was easier and we had better, Right. We could see the actual templates and they weren't this big and they could do the work, it would be easier for both people to be typing at the same time, you know, everything they're actually doing in real time. Yeah. Like, honestly, there's so many screens in here, like for mobile crisis calls, like we don't, generally don't, you know, address, like I'm not usually talking to a psychotic person about their life goals. Right. I mean, there might be sometimes, you know, if somebody's really depressed, we might be there for a while doing kind of like a long therapy session. Like, so we might get more information, but a lot of our crisis calls, you know, it's literally like, you know, do they need to go to the hospital or not? So. And I thought in the Dr. Cloud, we did this, the beginning and they did the demonstration. I thought that they had a crisis template from the state of Maryland, like another program within the state of Maryland that did mobile crisis also had Dr. Cloud. Did I mistaken that? Ryan, Chris, Neil? I know we have other agencies that do crisis using Dr. Cloud, yeah. Okay. Maybe we could look at their workflow, Ryan, Chris, if you have some templates you could show us. I think, and this, so when this is my observation, the Dr. Cloud team can tell me what they think. I haven't dealt in the next gen as much as I have in the last couple of weeks, trust me, it's a real crash course. But I think what is happening through a lot of the programs that I'm seeing is that a workflow was created as far as the eyes could see. And if you did that work, you're in that workflow. But it's not necessarily your workflow, right? So I know a lot of people use this comp assessment and this thing is a beast. And if you need one line out of the comp assessment, you are in there with everybody else, right? I am getting that sense that how, that's how these were developed, right? Which is highly inefficient, right? Because then you don't what you have, you don't, because when you give people way more than they need, they just get tired and don't do it at all. I'll tell you that right now, right? And I think that's what I'm seeing. That's my observation of how a lot of these templates were developed. So when, I don't know, that's what I'm seeing from when I'm seeing the programs going through a lot of these assessments. But I don't know, the Dr. Cloud team did say we can streamline it a little bit more where we can build a flow, you know, in a space where there are different programs using different parts of a template, right? So instead of you seeing everything, I don't need to build four different templates, I can build one, but it would activate based on that program. Chris, am I right? Am I? Correct, yep, exactly. Okay, okay. But I mean, from what you guys have been seeing, is that the same thing you've been seeing where these templates are really large and then people come in and they use little pieces of it, but it really wasn't built for their workflow? So when I say workflow, okay. Correct, like for instance, we were like, there are certain things that a crisis assessment must have, right? The safety, the risk, we must do a suicide risk assessment, the CSSSRS, right? But that's in a whole different template, but there's no, like there's, like it might prompt you like to do the risk assessment, but it doesn't like have a hyperlink to that assessment that then feeds into, you understand what I'm saying? Yes. So we were exactly what he was saying. We wanted it to be that certain items, like everybody has to do a social determinants of health, right? Everyone has to do one of those for public health and behavioral health, at least for behavioral health, we all have to do it. There should be a thing that they cannot move forward and complete their documentation, if you're the therapist or the case manager or however the program decides, unless you do that document and certain documents, right? That are authorized by CARF and by Comar. We didn't have that ability in NextGen because they said if we did it for one program, everybody had to do it, which is how we got to what we're talking about now, where everybody, there's nothing that's locked or determined that has to be done because we couldn't, because everybody would have to do it. But Dr. Clyde, you do have the SDOH and the PREPARE as standard templates, right? In your system, because those are state required ones. Yes, yes, yes. I don't know, we talked about this. I don't think we have the PREPARE, do we, Chris? But we can build it. Yeah, I'd have to look through our forms library to see. Yeah. I'm not recalling that we have that right off hand. I mean, it's a social determinants of health screening. Some people have another one that's like a bit longer than the PREPARE form. I mean, I prefer the shorter version. Yes. Which is this one. Which is this one. Yeah, sure. As for all of my programs, because we all have to do it, it's one of the things for CARP that's standard that we have to complete. I think what is, and I don't know if I'll get to do this work before July, right? So I'm gonna try to be very flexible and people probably throw a lot of eggs at me come July. But the issue is, there's also these assessments that are asking the same thing over and over. If you do the prepare, there's no need for you to ask the same question in a compass that's in a different template. Like you really don't need to. But I don't think an assessment of the template questions were done for NextGen, right? So we just put templates in. Like, oh, you need this? We have this. You need this? We have this. And then we do a comparison to say, okay, these psychosocial questions are the same one that's in these other psychosocial assessment. And if everybody has to do prepare, then these questions don't need to be in this other one. That wasn't done. Now I'm gonna ask person Ryan a question. I'm 18 years old. Are your library of templates smart enough to do, to make that assessment? So your library of assessments that you have, is there any AI built on top of it to see similar questions, similar domains of questions? When building the forms, you know, using our form builder tool, we can pull data from enter somewhere else into the next form in the series. So it wouldn't have to be. Right, I get that piece, but does your system know that the two data is the same? Right, so it knows a question in this form is the same as this other question in the other form. Like I would need to know that. That's kind of what I'm getting at. Chris, I think Dr. Numbard's saying, do we have like AI or something built in that's looking at the forms and scanning them and saying that you're asking the same question in multiple forms. Is that your question, Dr. Numbard? Yes, yes. Yeah, we don't have any AI built in that's doing that, but any thoughts, Chris? I mean, we should just share what we do for a lot of our screenings and intake forms, and then just figure out which programs are going to make best use of them. And then like Chris said, we'll just make sure that if data is being pulled into one, and there's another form that has that data that lives in it, it won't be duplicate entry. We'll just, we'll have it pulled in. But no, we don't have anything right off the bat that I can think of that's identifying whether there's duplicates in forms. Okay, but you guys are looking to go there. Yeah, that's part of, well, it's part of the analysis that we do anyways, when we're figuring out what forms to stand up with our customers. So it's a manual thing that happens today, but yeah, it's a good idea. Oh, that's stereotyping. Okay. Okay. All right, so Dornay, if you can send me everything, especially for mobile crisis on any kind of... Yeah, Beth will send you everything. Workflow, spreadsheets, documentation you use in the field, your referral form, those pieces. That would be very, very helpful. Let me put that in the chat. I have no more questions on Dr. Cloutier. Chris, Neil? No, I think I'm good. Thank you, thank you all. I appreciate this. And also your templates, Dornay, all your templates. Thank you, thank you very much, guys. Okay, thank you. Have a great day. Bye-bye, everybody. Bye. Bye.",
