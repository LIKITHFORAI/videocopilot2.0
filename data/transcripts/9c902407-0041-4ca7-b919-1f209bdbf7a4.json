  "text": "I mean, it's Monday. I'm like, good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. Hello. For everyone coming to the room. Happy New Year. Oh, we I have to give you your cup. I still have it. I will give you a cup next time I go down. Yes, yes, we go to various programs. Yes, I'll put it in my backpack. Yes. You know, I mean, most of the time, right? Yes, exactly. Good afternoon. Oh, go ahead. No, no, no, no. Go ahead. Thank you, everyone, for joining the workflow meeting. Just as transparency, this meeting is recorded. If anyone has any objections to that, I'll defer to Dr. Netbard. She'll give you a introduction into the meeting and then we'll get started. Thank you. OK, so thank you guys for joining. Joanne, thanks for welcoming. Welcome back. I guess you're going to be doing the demo today. So, team, what we're trying to do today is and I know we met with you guys before is to is one for one. So, we're we're ready to go. We'll have probably a ton of questions. The Dr. Cloud team might show you a little bit of the system if you wanted to know anything specific. So, we're going to go ahead and get started. OK, all right. Sounds good. So, this is the next gen scheduling system. So, this is the next gen scheduling system. So, this is the next gen scheduling system. Let's take this. And anything that you need to share with me, you can just share it and I'll put it in the folder that we have that we already created for your business process. OK, all right. Sounds good. So, this is the next gen scheduling side. The way we schedule for STI is extremely similar to the way we have been the way I've shown that we schedule for HIV medical and probably TB and immunizations as well. So, I'm here on the Sunday schedule just so I don't show any patient information. But basically what happens is we take very few walk-ins on the STI side and it would mainly be for rapid HIV testing. So, mainly, no, Beth says no. OK, so maybe not. Everything actually goes through the front. The front desk is like scheduling the appointments and checking in and doing all that. So, again, super similar here. We've got our appointment book. We have a set of appointments that are specific to STI. Now, there are several and they're this way because we report on each specific appointment type. If it's an HIV rapid, an immunization, PrEP 15 minute, PrEP 45 minute. So, a lot of this is quite specific. It's something that we'll probably need to work with the Doctor Cloud team to see. It can't just be medical appointment, follow-up appointment. There has to be a bit more detail into it. Yeah, and we need express testing actually included in this as well. So, as an example, I'm just going to choose one. We have the duration here. We can increase or decrease regardless. So, here we'll look up a patient. Same scenario, we're getting this information from the patient either on the phone or I guess in some rare occasions they'll come in. We have a form, which is the original NextGen registration form that asks a lot of this information so when they come in we get the clients to fill it out. But in the meantime, we're asking for a lot of specific information. So, as an example, this test patient. We would need to fill out anything here that is missing usually. I'll see stuff in red. I don't see it here now, but it would be, you know, basic demographics, address, all that sort of stuff. If it's an established client or a client that I can see that actually has a chart in NextGen. Let's use this one. We will, as you can see, alerts pop up, right? So, an automatic alert is if a privacy notice hasn't been signed or if there's a sliding fee scale attached to this patient. So, we'll go over updating any address, any phone number, anything along those lines, insurance, that kind of stuff. What I do like about the feature here is that we have history. This basically will tell you not just who was in the patient's chart, but if they changed something, what they changed. This is important, or at least it's been very helpful to us, mainly because if by some chance we change the patient's address and for whatever reason we change the wrong patient's address, we can always go back here and see what the previous old information was so we can update it and change it and kind of send it, make it go back to normal or something along those lines. And let's see. Other than that, we will schedule. A lot of this is not popping up because I'm on a Sunday schedule, but we have two locations in STI. We have the Germantown location and the Dennis Avenue location. Again, we report on many things, either as STI as a whole, which includes Germantown and Dennis Avenue, or separately. We'll need numbers for just Dennis Avenue. We'll need numbers for just Germantown. So, this part is also equally as important. The details section, we add stuff here. A lot of times it's specific for the provider, whether this is a syphilis contact or some sort of contact, anything specific, even symptoms or something along those lines will get added here. And then we schedule the appointment. We collect clinic fees in STI, so I would create a batch. I can't do it in production. The last one I created, I got finance to delete for me, but we would create a batch. When we check this patient in, you won't be able to see it because I don't have a batch created, but it would take me to a payment screen, and that's where we would add payments. Now, we have our own sliding fee scale, similar to HIV. In STI, we have a sliding fee charge. We can see patients that don't pay anything, but I don't remember the maximum. Beth, is it 60 or 30? I can't remember what our maximum clinic fee is. It's 30 currently. Joanne, I had a couple questions for you. You're a fast talker, so it's like playing dumb. Sorry. I'm just pulling your leg. I have a couple questions. Your sliding fee scale is the same for this program as which other program you said? As our HIV medical program. But it's not the state sliding fee scale. You guys have a different one? It's not. Okay, perfect. You've sent that in to me yet? I believe I did, but we can send it again. I can send it again. Yes, because I'm about to give them something, and I want to make sure. I want to figure out the difference between these two. Yeah, no problem. The other thing is for your appointments, is your availability public, and the clients can select slots? No. Okay, it's all internal? It's all internal, yeah. Okay. And the slot timing, there's a default time when you select a certain type of appointment, but we have the ability to adjust that. And, you know, sometimes that is at the provider's discretion, right? The default time might be 30 minutes, but for whatever reason, the provider may need 45, right? So we need to be able to adjust that as well. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Okay, so here, again, we would select E. If the patient actually has insurance, it's something that would have been added in by front desk staff. And if they are checking in, which they'd be checking in in person, we ask for that insurance card. Now, we're not getting much money back at some point. We hope that'll change. But if no money, if there is no insurance, and the client pays their clinic fee or doesn't, that part doesn't really matter, once the provider enters their CPT codes or billing codes, diagnosis code, we adjust everything out. The patient doesn't carry a balance. We don't send the patient any bills. That's kind of set up in our grant. There are also certain groups of patients that do not pay. So I believe it's anyone under the age of 18 or 19 doesn't pay anything, regardless of what the appointment type is. Contact patients, so patients that have been named as a contact for someone that tested positive for an STI come in and get tested here. Those patients do not get charged. So we have certain groups of patients that do not get charged. There is a non-chargeable list that the state provides. So anyone that kind of fits into that category. So send that to me when you send the slide in the scale thing. Okay. Where do you put that in the system to indicate that this person is a part of that group? There is no place to put it in the system. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So it would be great to have it. Okay. I need that noted. I was just asking to be facetious. I figured there wasn't any place, but this is something very important to put in. So there is a distinction for this group of people, right? Once you put that there, that's what triggers. Okay. Yeah, exactly. All right. So then the patient is checked in. And then that's pretty much it. The checkout is similar to what I showed in the HIV medical. You're checking out. You are adding any payments that the client has made with their clinic fee. And if not, then you are adjusting everything out. I can't show it because then I would have to create something, and then I'd have to send a ticket to finance and see if they can remove it for me, which was an ordeal the last time. That's fine. It's okay because you showed it the last time. I have a couple more questions. When they make a payment to you in the office, how is that logged, and what receipt do they get? So when they do, we enter it in the beginning of the appointment, right? So it's entered as a transaction. And I don't know if you remember, but there is a setup in NextGen where it's asking, do you want that payment to be a credit on this account or on this encounter? Yes. So we have the payment be a credit on the encounter. So when we're checking out, that payment is then already deducted from any services that we've given, meaning any CPT codes or anything like that that sort of pop up. And then everything else is adjusted out. When they say account, is that the client account? Yeah. So ideally, if it's connected to the client account, then really any program in the system could use that, let's say $5 for our purposes, towards their clinic fee. So if this person, let's say, yeah, goes to behavioral health, that's on their account, technically they could be used for any encounter. You see, that's not supposed to happen. It's supposed to still go to the person's account and be locked not to be used somewhere else. But that's fine. I think so that's the reason why it's not on their account. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's why we have it on the encounter and not on the account. Yeah. And occasionally, you know, we make mistakes and it gets put on the account. We have to get finance to adjust that for us. Okay. So I need the Dr. Cloud team to answer regarding functionality around those payments. Before that, does the system create a receipt? Yes, at the end or after I finish checking in. There is a receipt that gets created, which is part of the fee ticket. I see. And the Dr. Cloud team, how do you handle the indication of someone's payment? Is it on service or on account or is it both? It's both, yeah. It's both. And can it be locked on the account where it can't be used as a credit for other services? I mean, this is an integrated service space, so. Yeah. Well, if it's entered at the time of receiving the service as a copay, then it's tied to that service. But if it's just a generic payment, it is allocated by the accounting team. Whoever would determine where to apply the payment. Okay. But once you get it through that program and that service, it's just locked anyway because you're associating with that service? Yes. Okay. Thank you. So we actually tried to add copays for certain clients in the very beginning. There's a section here for it, but there has to be an insurance attached to it. We have kind of this, it's not a real insurance. It's called non-billable. So we thought about attaching it here, but other programs use that. So it wouldn't make sense. Our copay would be one thing and other programs would be another. So we wouldn't be able to use non-billable. We thought about adding an insurance that was called, let's say, Ryan White or something along those lines. But when we tried doing testing on it, this copay functionality, it just, I don't know, it just wasn't working. But that was something that we toyed with because it's something that needs to be changed and adjusted based on the person's income. We assess every year. But, you know, if the person comes back in six months and lost their job and have zero income, then, you know, we're changing it. So that's kind of where we're at. Yeah, but the thing is, so here, let me, so this question is for the doctor team group. Oh, Diana, I see your hand. Give me one second. This copay can be triggered by program influenced by a sliding fee scale rule, influenced by an insurance combination sliding fee scale rule. That copay functionality in Dr. Cloud do have some flexibility? So ours is going to be similar to what you're already have there. It's going to be the specific payer that covers the specific programs. We can set a copay for each payer that's entered. So I'm curious, why is it that you're not entering, you don't have insurance information at this point? Well, yeah, so one, you know, we have some clients that come in with private insurance. We're not paneled with any insurance, any private insurance company. So we can't send, you know, bills out or anything along those lines. So we don't have a lot of those private insurance companies on here. I can show you what we do have. So this is the list here. Some are private. I don't know how up to date some of those things are. We don't have any Medicare Advantage plans here. We have Medicare Part B, but that's about it. And then we have a lot of MA here, and some are old. So, yeah. So, but I think what the DOCTR team is saying that that copay can only be triggered on the selection of the insurance to pay. Yes, yes, which is why we toyed with the idea of creating our own, quote, unquote, insurance, so that we could have a copay that was specific to us. But like I said, when we did testing, and this was a while back, when we did testing, it didn't work out. So it wasn't pulling up. It wasn't triggering it. So it just. So if there's no insurance, Joanne. There's no way to put a copay. So that's what I'm getting at. Yeah. So I don't know if it's Neil or Chris that answered just now. I think that's what I'm getting at, because not in any circumstance, they probably have no insurance. What do you do in terms of no insurance? How does the copay get triggered? Right. So if that's the case, there's a paper form that we. No, no, not you, Joanne. I'm talking about the DOCTR Cloud team. Sorry. Sorry. Because I know we're about to revert to some external stuff. Yep, exactly. Right now. But in terms of the DOCTR Cloud team, what is the functionality behind no insurance? Well, so the functionality is we assume that the client is paying the bill if they don't have any insurance entered. And so we default everything to client pay if there's no insurance captured. So we default to self pay. Yeah. And under the self pay by program, can I have a specific low fee amount? So what you would do is you would enroll them in a self pay sliding fee scale program or insurance. And then that would adjust their charges for everything that they receive in terms of services. OK, you'd have to show us how that is, because I mean, you're the program. When you say program, the program is STI testing. So where you would have to create two instances of program. No, you would you would enter the client information. You would admit them to the program. And then or or when you're entering the client info, you would say, OK, this is what we've determined for this person in terms of their financial assistance level. Right. Which is sliding fee scale or, you know, they're going to pay 100 percent of the bill, whatever that is. I see. If it's 100 percent of the bill, you don't do anything. They just they just get the bill and they need to pay it. But if if they are on a sliding fee scale, you would say, OK, they're in our five percent or 10 percent tier for the fee scale. And that you would just enroll them in that. And then that would that would cause all of their services to be adjusted down to whatever that rate is. OK, so it really it's based on. OK, it's not really the payee at that point. Yeah, no, it's it's just the what they qualify for in terms of financial assistance in the tier that they're in. OK, sorry, Diana. Thank you, Chris. Diana. No. Joanne, keep going. Oh, so sorry. One moment. She put her comment in the chat. So we have grant funding. I mean, nothing should be quote unquote. Everything has a space. There's grants, sliding scale, self pay and insurance. So that in the chat, that's what she said. Basically, there needs to be, you know, various categories of the various grant of all the grants. at self-paying sliding fee. Yeah, I think that's what Chris was saying. It's not really on the payee, it's on a different part of the system, but it seems as if it can be accommodated, right, Chris? Yes, yeah, absolutely. I know that currently in NextGen, we're not able to have two sliding fee scales. So with Dr. Cloud, are we able to have multiple sliding fee scales? I'm hoping that's a yes. Yes, yeah. So the question would be, you know, can you be a little bit more specific, like what the scenario would be? Are we talking about for one type of service, they're in a percentage and another? No, so it would be, well, it would be program-related, right? So as an example, we could have a patient that's being seen in some outside program that adheres to the state's sliding fee scale with percentages and all that sort of stuff. Our program would be different, even the income ratios and everything would be different. In some programs, we have a nominal fee. In other programs, we have kind of a sliding fee. So would they be able to potentially be in two or three different sliding fee scales? Yes, absolutely. Because we assign the financial assistance or payer tier by program. So when you enroll and when you say, okay, they have this payer or they're paying at this level for this program, that could be put in, and then you'd have another level for a different program, that's, we can accommodate all that. Okay, and if the sliding fee says the patient needs to pay, their portion is, let's say, $10, they don't have that, we can adjust that out. Is that right? Yes, correct. Okay, all right. And there will be a trail for that. So that's why I need you to send me yours, because the one that we looked at in the other meeting, Chris, was the state. And that's the one that changes a lot. Joanne, for the ones that you have, on what frequency does it change? Is it calendar year or fiscal year? It changes yearly, based on when the client brings in their eligibility information. Oh, no, no, no, not that. I'm talking about the actual scales themselves. Oh, whenever the federal poverty level comes out, that's when we change it. Yeah. Okay, I just, I need that. When you send me that, just send me that. Yeah, absolutely. So that's it, as far as this part goes. There's scanning that gets done, we have outside forms that are completed, and all that sort of stuff, and all that gets done by the front desk. But that's probably it on this side. Again, there are reports. I'll send a list of all the data points from the different reports that we need. But that's it on this side. So I think I can stop sharing, and then Obie can show you the medical side. Hi, Joanne. Hey. Is it possible to use one of the test patients? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, yeah. You can use, I just checked in December test, so there should be an encounter there for that. December test. It's not showing on mine yet. It's not showing for me. Can you guys hear me? Yeah, Obie, can you share your screen, and then maybe we can walk you through it? Okay, yeah, I can. Give me a second. Yeah. Oh, I know why, because I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to share my screen. Oh, I know why, because I checked it in under myself. So let me check it in under you. So, of course, you wouldn't be able to see it. All right, let me go here. Just a second here. Okay. Obie, are you in the patient's chart? I'm trying to, first off, share, right? Got it. Let me see, share. Screen on the top to share. Is it sharing now? No? No, I don't see anything. You don't see anything. Give me a second. It's... Right, the third screen. Oh, no, I hope this is not gonna affect. Let's see. Okay. Share. Are you guys seeing it now? Yes. Yes. Good. So let me go, this is the first step we do take. Let me see if it's there now, if you've checked the person in. Yeah. Do you see it? So look on Sunday, look on the 11th. Okay, Sunday. Yeah. Yesterday? Yeah. Great, okay. Usually when patients come in and they've gone through front office with everything they have to do, they are checked in and it shows kept. So we just go in there and double click on it. And it pulls up this. This is the screen that we have as providers. So, it shows the date. You choose the, because sometimes, you know, the case managers might open up a chart for that day, but I do go to choose the one that is opened by the front office for that visit. So that the phlebotomies and everybody will work on that particular, that particular visit. That particular trend, not the one that was opened up by either DIS or the PrEP navigator. So we, I click on this, then click on this. Just bear with me because there are a lot of clickings. So when we click on this, we choose the visit, which is SOAP. Now here, we have the option, if we're sending a message to maybe the nurse, we're putting the treatment for a patient, or we're sending a message to any of the staff, really, and it's about the patient and you want it to be in that patient's chart. We choose provider test action, but I'll come to that later. Let me just go for a visit, normal visit. And for our visits, like Joanne had mentioned, we have different types of visits, right? It could be a complaint, maybe they're having discharge or whatever. It could be for PrEP, that the provided ones, the visits that the providers see. It could be for syphilis. Syphilis is in its own category. And it could just be for a follow-up. And a follow-up could be, like somebody that was started on PrEP 30 days ago is coming for a visit. And that's a follow-up because technically it's billed differently because again, the patient could be seen via telehealth or they come into the clinic and those are billed differently. So when I open up this chart to choose SOAP, it brings up all of this and I'll just basically try to get it out and then go to the specialty. We have to choose the specialty every time. You choose internal medicine. If it has to do with the provider or the nurse or as long as it comes from the provider, you choose internal medicine. And so you do okay. And this will be an office visit because they are seeing the provider. If they're going to see the nurse, assuming I'm putting a treatment in, I will choose a nurse visit. Now, this is where also if the person came for, is being seen via telephone or video, you choose it here. So the virtual visits are down here too. So for this, I'm choosing the office visit and I say, okay. So here, the tab on the left is where we choose what the person is here for. Almost 90% of our visits is STD screening. And when you click on it, then you will click on this, my phrases, to choose what the, these are all, we already pre-loaded. So you choose what the person is here for. If it's a female that is here for PrEP initiation, you choose that and whatever. I'm just going to choose that and say, okay. Let me see if I can get this out. And say, insert and close. So when we close it, it comes back to save and close. It comes back to here, right? So this is where it's more like, yeah, our chief complaint, what the person came for. You type in everything you have here. Let me choose a better one, sorry. This doesn't show all the stuff that, okay. Insert and close. Let me, okay. So this is like, you know, what the questions we ask patients and all that. When we finish with the round of questions, we just save and close. So the next thing we do is go for the ROS, review of systems. Because I chose a female, it's going to pull up, of course, review of system for a female. You come here, you choose whatever you need to choose. We have to click, click, click, click all the way, whatever you need and save, right? So I'm just going to do that, do a few and save. So it populates here. Just for the Montgomery County team, is it possible for us to get a list of those texts, blurbs that you're inserting in that first step? Which one? This one? Oh, the last one. I mean, this we would need as well, but. Yes, we need this, yeah. The My Phrases? Yeah. My Phrases? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you can get them because that means you now basically transfer them to the new system, right? And we'll be able to, yes. It's very, very, yeah, important. I think it was a question for Selwyn. Is this something we can get by program? Program? I have to, I think- No, no, no, no. I think, Obie, I was asking the IT team because we were wondering- Oh, okay, okay. Because your team is not the only one that has these specific type of often used phrases that they created. So I was wondering if Selwyn had any kind of way for us to actually get this by program, by location. Sorry, I keep saying program, but it's location. IT will open a ticket to next gen to determine. Okay, thank you, Sherry. Okay, so I should continue? Yeah, so we're- Yes, Obie, thank you. Yeah, review of systems. And then there is this other aspect that we have to complete, the confidential. Confidential also asks for the questions about sexual health and practices. So we click on that, click on the sexual health and fill in whatever numbers we need to fill in and say, okay, so here, yes, active. How many people? One, I choose one. And then lifetime partners, I choose 10. And I say, okay, HIV for today. Okay, if they have had any of these infections before you put it there, do they have any risks? These are the risk factors we choose. And then we say, okay, now it's confidential. Nobody sees it except you actually go in there and then you'll be able to see that. So this is where we put the vitals. The temperature is basically what we take, the only thing we take. So I put it in and say save and close. Then we come to our physical exam. We have this one page form that you could use and just everything is basically here. You can do that, save and come out. Or if you wanna go system by system, constitution, you have everything and you choose whatever you need to choose and close. But we normally use the one page because it's faster. And if there's anything, if you want more details, you can actually click on a particular system to click whatever you wanna click. Now, this is where we put our assessment and we use the AP details. Here we can navigate to any tab really. So for the AP details, here we add assessment. This person already has some, if it's the same assessment he's had before, I mean, she's had before like this assessment Z for screening for infections. If anything is new, you can go and choose here on our favorites. These are saved already as favorites, right? You can choose any one. If you're searching for a code, this doesn't pull up. I mean, there are some systems that if you just maybe put rash, right? This one will pull up rash, I think this is easy. But it doesn't pull up certain things. Some systems you just put a few words and search and it will pull up everything that has the word and makes it easy. So if it's something that doesn't pull up, you really have to use your phone or use another computer, search for what the diagnostic code is and put it in here like Z71.2 and you search, you can click on that because that wasn't there. I mean, I wouldn't have been able to pull it up if I had just typed in the words. So you do that and you save, you can save your favorites when you pull it up, you can save it. And then from this screen, you can go to, not my plans, you can go to the AP details. Then the diagnostic codes are all there and the assessment codes are there, sorry. Then you can come here. This is where I put, I choose my plan, okay? As soon as I give the person medication, fluconazole, I can choose that plan and say, and adjust whatever I need to adjust and say insert and close. Now, also on this screen is where we can add labs. And the labs that we do add as providers is basically maybe you ordered a urine dip or you ordered pregnancy, urine pregnancy test or future lab for, you know, maybe a lab going to the states like oral, gonorrhea, chlamydia, what else? You can go and add any lab, but technically the phlebotomists do add most of the everyday labs that we use for screening, STI screening. So, but here, if I add a code for pregnancy and encounter, let me see, pregnancy. While here, I can go to the lab. And since it's in-house, I'll leave it in-house. I'll go to, I'll find the pregnancy, click on it, then come here to search for the practice favorites. These were already saved up. And then choose urine pregnancy and say save. So what this does is when the nurse does the pregnancy test, they can go in, the lab is already ordered and they can put the result in there. And the provider will be able to see it on the labs. And while we are here, the next thing we use is the office procedures. That's where we go to put in medication for that visit. And these medications, because we have them in the clinic, the nurse will be, by the time we put it in, the nurse will be able to see it and then dispense at the end when the provider is done with the patient. So what we do is like for, we click on the code that it affects. I would just choose any code. I'll choose this code and I will go in here, click on it and choose whatever medication I'm using for that code. I will choose acyclovir. And I'll say, okay, all of these, I don't know what they mean, but I say yes. Now, since acyclovir is an oral med, I'll click on medication and I go to dosing. I'll choose the dose. I think this, I can choose 400 and come out and say milligram. And then it brings me to oral. I have to indicate that it's oral medication. And I'll say, okay, I close here. Then I'm, and I want to send it to the nurse, either the STI nurse or the nurse at Germantown. STI is for Dennis Avenue. And then I can choose the STI nurse. I'll bring it over. Now, when you choose the STI nurse here, you're supposed to actually double click and it goes over, it doesn't. But if you choose a name, you choose a name of a patient or whoever, and you double click, it goes over. I don't know why, but you say, okay, and then save. At this point, you can just save all the way and come out. Yeah, save and close, save and close, and save and close. So this is what you have. The medication I ordered shows, and the nurse will see it and be able to, but now I still have to go to prescriptions here, Rx, and add the medication manually. Well, yeah, manually. However, there are some few medications that we have. When you go to the medication module and add it or procedure or whatever, office procedure and add it, it shows up here. So it would be great to have every medication that you pick from the office module, from the office procedure, to show up in the Rx so that we don't have to add it, basically add it manually. So here I'll have to come and look for, we already saved this medication, so I'll look for aciclovir. It's right there. You double click on it. Sometimes it comes over, sometimes it doesn't. Okay, you say cancel because I've done it twice now. Okay, select. Now, this is where you specify, it's already set the number of days and all that. However, if you wanna extend the number of days for treatment, you can do that here. You just edit and type in 10 days. once but that means you change the number of pills you're dispensing. Let me see where is it. Okay. Click on. What did I do? I'm not seeing everything. Give me a second please. Oh, I cleared it. Okay. I shouldn't have. Okay. Give me a second. Let me get. I can't get out of there. No. You want to close without 70 years. Okay. Sorry. I'll go back there and I'll type it. I'll choose my medication. A lot of medications are not there but most of the ones that we use are there. The ones that we don't have are basically maybe the ones that we don't have at the clinic here. So I will choose this again. Select. Like I said, if you want to change it, you can change it. Then you just say accept. But if you made any changes to the CIG, as you put 10 days, I will have to go down here somewhere to accept it. To say done. I'll say done. Then I'll come out again and I'll change the number of medication now to be 20. And I'll say accept. That's when everything updates. After this, we don't have to do anything again because it's in-house medication. So we don't have to do anything. However, if I chose that medication and I'm sending it to a pharmacy, I will have to click on send. And this person has a pharmacy there. All I need to do is to say send again. And it shows that it has been ERXed. That's how we know that it's gone through. So after sending the prescription, okay. And one of the questions that we ask, of course, is medication allergies. So when you get the allergies or they don't have any allergies, you come and put it in here. Do you want me to go through how we put in allergies? Yeah, that'd be great. Yes, please. Thank you. Okay. So as when the person said that they have allergy, I mean, rash with say azithromycin, right? So you come here with this stuff, click on it. You search for azithro. Oh, sorry. Azithro. It comes up. So you choose any, I mean, I normally choose the basic one and I say, okay. Now, it's not done. I have to come in here and add under reactions. I'll click on add and I will choose rash. I will choose rash or any other thing that it causes. Now, I will come again and click add. Because, I mean, I never witnessed the rash or anything. This severity always shows not assessed. So, because you didn't see it. The person is just reporting. So when you add it, then you say, okay, it comes here. However, it's, I mean, it hasn't, the allergy has not updated until you click on add. Then you reconcile. It brings up this form. I don't know what it means, but you just, you know, exit and then it will update. So we're going to see the rash here. I mean, azithromycin here. Yeah. So that's how we put allergies. Let me see. And also, I mean, if you don't add the allergy, whether they have allergy or not, you know, no known allergies, for some reason, on this right column, the labs will not pop up and the prescription will not pop up. For some reason, I don't know why, but that's next gen. So when you do the medication, the nurse would have gotten all of this. That means you are basically done with your visit. Now, if you put any code, of course, we do go under it to put our plan of care for that code. And when we're done, we save. So at this point, you're done with the visit. I mean, when you finish putting in the review of system, everything else, when you are done, you now have to come and finalize. Finalize is where we put our billing code. This is where we choose. If the person established is already there, if the person is new, by the time they check the person and you will see they're new. So that would know what billing code to choose. We choose our modifier, which is usually 25. Except if you did a telehealth visit by phone, you choose this UB services. So I'm going to choose 25 because a normal visit. And because the person has been here and the person came for a visit that lasted maybe 40 minutes, I click on this and I submit. I submit. If I do this, I won't be able to do anything with this chart again. So do you want me to submit anyway? I can submit. It doesn't matter. So you see how it is. Obie, before you submit, could you show how you enter the BICELIN? One second. BICELIN chats. Obie, before you leave the screen. Okay. Scroll down for me real quick. So these are all... The codes, right? Oh, so, okay. That's why it looks a little nutty. I was like, okay, so behavioral health code, everybody's code is here? It's here. Yes. Yes. Okay. So it's not segregated by program? No, it's not. Yeah, it's not. Okay. Which set of codes do you normally use? Which one? We use the new patient, established patient. Then for telehealth, we use this. And for follow-up visits, we use this too. This 99024. Scroll back over for me. Is that generic codes, Diana, for intake across programs? Oh, sorry. You're on. Oh, I'm sorry. You can't speak. Okay. Probably is. I think because these codes are also used in primary care and all that. So I guess... Right. So the top ones are the generic ones. Yeah. And so this is by time? Sorry. Those are E&M codes. Yeah. Anybody can use those. That's for Medicare as well. Yes. Sorry. Yeah. The E&M codes are by time? By time. Yeah. Okay. Time and visit type too. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Obi. All right. Let me go back to SOAP. So let me put the bisaline. The bisaline populates to the prescription when we put it. So let me go there. And I'll just basically choose the syphilis. And I'll say... I'll go there. When I choose that, I can just go to the office procedures and I'll click on syphilis. I go here, search for the bisaline, which is this one. This is the one we use, penicillin G. And we say, okay. Now you have to choose injection. And we choose the dose in strength. It's two, four, one, two, three, four, five. And you say, okay. Okay. Then you choose the units. Intramuscular. And you say, okay. Now we don't have to choose whether they put it on the right because it's the nurse that will determine that or the patient determines that. So we close that. We place the order to STI. And we just say save and close, save and close, and save and close. It appears here. Then if you give it a minute or second, it's going to show here. It's there. So which is the ideal thing? If you prescribe a medication, it should really just show on this side. Now, let me mention something about our prescription for NextGen, which is a problem that we've been having, or we do have sometimes. When we are prescribing a medication that is to the pharmacy. Okay. To the pharmacy. Technically, the ICD code should match the medication that we are sending. But unfortunately, our prescription goes through without any ICD code. So I've had pharmacists basically not fill that medication because there was no ICD code. Or they will call what is the ICD code. So technically, every medication you send should be attached to an ICD code, just like our internal medications. When we order it internally, it's attached to a code for every visit. Yeah. I think the Dr. Cloud team will have this. I'm not sure why, because most of the EHR does. The Dr. Cloud team, the request for medication, it goes with the ICD code, correct? Yeah. I mean, it just gets sent to the pharmacy. I'm trying to think if... I haven't heard of that being an issue. Oh, okay. Yeah. Is that a NextGen thing or is that... I think it's a NextGen thing. Okay. Yeah. Most of the time, how they know... I mean, of course, they know about PrEP medication and other medication, but you might have to basically specify it under here. I could just say there's COVID, da, da, da, da, da, for PrEP. But we've had issues with that. Okay. So this visit, that's basically our visit that will go and we do all the... Should I go ahead and basically bill for that and lock it? Then I will show us how we send our internal messages and all that. Yeah, that would be great. Okay. So I'll just do finalize. I would choose... Okay, it's already... Now, we don't have the... Here, we don't have the option of primary diagnosis, assuming... Because sometimes you could just put generic diagnosis or rather common diagnosis, if the person's going to screen for HIV, blah, blah, blah. But if the person, actually, the primary reason the person came is for syphilis. As you can see, syphilis is the number four. Well, I haven't figured out a way to make syphilis number one as a primary code. So that also is next gen issue, I guess. So what happens is that they've been creating this themselves in the programs. We do need to associate the medications that she was mentioning with the ICD codes. However, the problem is that that is something that I don't know if it was part of the medication module that we did not have with next gen. Oh, I see. Yeah. Okay. We'll need to be linked to that. You know what I mean? But I hope that Dr. Clow already have that and that we include that in the contract. Okay. So I'm using my phone because the computer don't want to start. Okay. So I'm forced to use this generic screening code as the visa for that day. And so when I come here, I just, okay, it's already, when I chose it before, it took, I chose the 25 modifier and I chose this. So it's already taken. And when I submit the code, of course it tells me, oh, not all Zikos are, yeah, primary diagnosis, which is what I mentioned earlier, but I will be like, yes, I need it to go. So Okay. So it brings up this form, this, yeah. So here, I still am able to make corrections. As you mean, I forgot to put in something. You make all your corrections, you go through it and all that. If you're sure you're okay, then your note is locked only when you click this, when you sign off. And you sign off and it just shows you, this is it. It's done, it's a master, whatever. So the next thing that we do as providers is, like I mentioned, if you have to send treatment, assuming you reviewed the labs and there was a positive chlamydia, and you need to send treatment order to the nurse. So let me assume it's the same day today. I would just go here, click on provider test section and say, okay. And so now, it's no longer going to be office visit, right? Here, I will have to change it to the nurse visit, because they're going to come and see the nurse, they won't see the provider. So when you do that, you go in here, assuming the person had oral chlamydia, it's always good to make sure it shows in the patient's chart. So you go in there to choose an assessment code. I will just add, I'll look for chlamydia and choose pharynx. Yeah. How much more time do we need to finish what we're working on now? No, this is the last bit, basically. When you choose chlamydia, you still go through the other process. And when you went, I mean, you go and choose the medication and all that, you send it to the nurse and you save. So that's the way we send messages to the nursing to the nurses, or if you have a message for DIS or for PrEP navigator and all that, that message shows up as provider test action. And so, yeah, that's it. Here is where we go to review labs. The provider, this is the queue for the labs, you review and it goes. Now, clinical tasking, that message is sent to the nurse for medication for the patient that came in and for the person that tested positive for syphilis, they are all here. So that's it, basically. So I think that's, I wanted to see your management screen, but you can just send that to me, like how you manage most of these things. I guess it's just on the appointment OB, but if you could just screenshot that and send it to me, that'd be great. Because I know we're at time and thank you so much. This has been the most detailed walkthrough I've ever been through, but I really appreciate this. The Dr. Cloud team, I'm thinking you guys will have questions as you look through, especially this walkthrough again. Do you mind sending those questions in the chat of this team meeting? Because I think we've gone through a lot. We haven't been able to ask many questions, but if you guys have any questions, if you just send it here, it'd be great. I have, because I know we all have to run, but Joanne, OB, thank you guys so much for showing all of this. Again, if you guys have your reports, just send them to me, your reporting need. If you can send them to me, that'd be great. And where you actually manage most of the risks, things that you need to reach out to customers for, how you do that, if that's possible. Thank you, thank you, thank you. If there's no other questions at this time, thank you all. And we look forward to next meeting. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.",
