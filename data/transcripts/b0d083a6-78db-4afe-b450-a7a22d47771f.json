  "text": "Sorry, guys, I was speaking, I'm sorry, I was on mute, how are you? How are you, sir? Daniel before our two o'clock. Can you do me a favor and send you the link to our SharePoint, I just need you to glaze over the updates from yesterday. Morning. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Can you please check your invite and see if Chris was on this I don't see him on but we need them. I just boarded it. Are you there somewhere. Yes, I'm here. Okay, can you check and see if Chris was on the original. I'm pinging him. Good morning. Hello everybody. Morning. See. Hello. Let me see we were a Melvin and Joanne. I'm calling Joanne Joanne. Okay. I'll pick Melvin. Joanne is just waiting. Good morning, everybody. She's waiting to be let in. Oh, okay. Sorry. Hi, maybe I logged into the wrong meeting because I was just waiting waiting. Not sure. So this wasn't on my calendar guys so I'm not completely at home yet. So, but I think the team isn't new so that's a good thing so we can go right in. Yeah, enjoy and it's a pro now. All right. So yeah, I can get started. Let me share my screen. Yes. Okay. All right, so I'm gonna go a bit slow here. So, yeah, I can get started. Let me share my screen. All right. Are you able to see my screen? Yes. Okay. All right. So I'm gonna go a bit quickly through this part because it's very similar to all of the scheduling that we've done so far. So basically with HIV case management or specialty medical CM, which is what we call it, there are some basic workflows. So we have our support services staff. They are the ones that see kind of walk-in clients. They'll do initial intakes and just kind of, you know, provide some basic case management. We have our medical social workers, which have a caseload. They see clients that are newly diagnosed or that have complex sort of cases when it comes to HIV treatment adherence. We have our non-medical case managers who are for clients that don't have HIV needs, meaning that they're undetectable, but that have other biopsychosocial needs. It could be facing eviction or something along those lines. Then we have our HOPWA team, and they cover our housing rental assistance program, which helps out with mortgage, rent, utilities, and there's also long-term sort of rental assistance through there. But the basic intake or scheduling of clients is this. We have a lot of different types of events or appointments, and that's what I use to pull reports and address kind of services. So if I say that we're doing an intake, I'm going to bump it up to 30 minutes, and I'm going to find a client. So let's do this client. Let's pretend it's this client. If there's anything missing, we'll see red fields. We'll add stuff on here if it is missing, or at the very least, we'll ask if the information is still correct and update any demographic information. Let's just say okay. Okay. So now the appointment is scheduled. I'm going to check the appointment in, and this is all being done by the staff. Our front desk doesn't do any of this. So we're also filling out outside forms and all that sort of stuff. So here I'm checking the patient in. When I get to this point, I'm going to add an insurance, and because all of our case management services, support services, housing services, it's all non-billable. I'm going to add that as our insurance. Okay. Again, I'm going to add in any red fields if needed, just so the pop-up doesn't keep coming up. I'm going to say that the person signed their privacy notice today, and I'm going to make sure non-billable is attached to this encounter. Okay. Now I am still the support services worker. I'm going to go into the EHR. Now there's several ways to get to the patient here, because I know which patient I want. I'm just going to click on it. So this is the encounter. So if I'm support services staff, we have a template that is pretty basic and kind of fits our needs for that. Our specialty is going to be care management. And then this template actually has a couple of different panels here. So we have provider interactions. We could use this. We very rarely do. The main ones we use are telephone interactions and face-to-face interactions. So if this person is here in front of me, I'm going to add a face-to-face interaction. This right here, the purpose of the interaction, we actually run reports on this as well. So I can choose from what's here on the list, or if I select this blank space up here, I can type it in myself. And then this has a character limit. So there's only about so much you can type here. So we'll type until it stops, and then we'll continue to type after we generate the document, if needed. So save, close. And then down here, I'm going to hit this case and consent summary. And it generates the note, right? So here I can continue to add words. And I'm going to save that again. Then after I'm done, I'm going to go to finalize. I'm going to add an assessment. I'm going to add an assessment. So for us, the assessment is always an HIV diagnosis. We only see clients that are HIV positive, and we only see adults. So it's pretty cut and dry there. Save and close. And then here we actually have two codes that we use. For the majority of our services, we use this W code. It was a code given to us by the state. It's an HIV ongoing case management code. I remember when NextGen first started, it had to be added because it wasn't part of the list of codes that were uploaded. I don't know if that's still the case. But we would add this code, and then we submit the code. Now, the code, we have to adjust the units for the code. One unit equals 15 minutes. So we would basically go to our procedures, click on here, update the units. And yes, there's no modifier. And then, again, this is the same staff member. Then it's going back into their schedule, and then they're checking out. They're auto-flowing. Make sure non-billable is the payer. And then this adjusts everything out. And then you can auto-flow through. We don't do batches. We don't collect money. We don't collect any clinic fees or anything like that when it comes to any services on the case management side. Now, for the social workers or for the medical case managers and non-medical case managers, we have a different set. We have different templates that we use, different workflows. This workflow is the same for our HOPWA program, which is our housing program. Again, we have separate forms and everything that gets filled out and scanned in. But to document a client encounter, we're going to follow the exact same steps, use the same template. So I'm not going to go through that. It's the same billing code and everything. So what I'm going to go through is an initial assessment, which is the same as our reassessment for medical case management, and it's similar to non-medical case management. So I'm going to select the event. Check in. Again, we're going to update anything that needs to be updated from the time that the intake happened to the time that the initial assessment is happening. So here is my encounter. So now I'm going to go into our template. It's a comprehensive assessment. So here we change our specialty. Our specialty is behavioral health, and we use intake no medical services. It was just something that was assigned to us from NextGen. Depending on the visit type, you get different links connected here or different choices on your, I don't know, home bar right here. So this basically is our comprehensive assessment. We have to go through all these, except for functional, all these templates. So before you do this, you actually have to connect that patient to the program. So this is a NextGen thing. So you would go here. The program category would be PH specialty medical CM. It automatically defaults to me. Whoever the social worker is, it would default to. The start date is today, and then I add it. So then when I go to program name, now it's on there, and I can add my program name. Start time, you can either say click on this little clock, which gives you the exact time, or you can manually enter it yourself. Okay. So here we have my phrases here, but a lot of our social workers don't necessarily use it. We have a list of questions that need to be answered in this reason for referral. A lot of that is because of our grant and what the auditors look for when they come in and look through our assessments. So for now, I'm just going to put test, and then I'm going to go to the social history. There are a lot of panels here. We go through the living situation panel. A lot of these have drop-downs, but if you click on the blank space in the top, you can manually enter anything you need. I'm just going to enter anything here. And we complete the social supports panel. Let's keep going. We complete the adult education panel. Let's just say education. Okay. We'll also complete employment status. We can add the type of employment to the grid. And we complete legal. A lot of this is we don't go into much detail, but this is just kind of all part of our history. Military, we complete. Trauma history, we complete. Sexual issues, we complete. And this is where we kind of do our sexual history. This is blank, so we have a lot of questions that we need to answer here. So a lot of it is in a separate form that all the social workers get so that they can make sure we answer all the questions that we need to for our audits. We do not complete development or education, child and adolescent. Family information, we will complete if it's relevant. We enter whether the client has children. And we'll, you know, complete name, all that sort of stuff. Date of birth, if needed. And then living with and if there's any sort of custody issues. Let's see. Joanne, for the form that you just mentioned, do you want that form to be built here so that you don't have to have a separate form somewhere else? So it's not so much a form, it's questions that we need to make sure that all the social workers answer when they're doing the assessment. Okay, so it would be better to have it here so you can run reports on things whenever needed, right? Yeah, and it's mainly for, it's hard to run reports on text fields. It's, yeah, it's extremely hard to run reports on text fields. All we can do is potentially identify. So let's say I want to see if anybody's talked about pregnancy. I can run a template report for that specific field and any, give me any encounters that have the word pregnant or preg, right, and then it'll pull that up. But then I have to go into each and every one of those charts to actually read that section to find out whether that person has a pregnancy history, right? So that's the only issue with a lot of those text fields. But, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of stuff that if these questions could be built in, even if we could have a more robust sexual history section, you can see ours is just this free text field. and the heart of our assessments are our sexual history, right? So that would be good to mention, so that they know exactly what you need. Yeah. You don't have to have a separate, like, workaround flow, you know. Rishon, I'm sorry. Sorry, I was trying to ask. I was on the phone. I think because this meeting wasn't on my calendar, I couldn't even get back in. But Joanne, so I understand assessments to be a certain thing, and I think we've been using the term assessments very loosely in the last few days, right? Is this a Sanders-Ise assessment for the population of individuals? So, yes and no. I mean, there are fields that we have to cover because it's part of our grant. It's in COMAR, right? All the specific topics that we need to cover for an HIV assessment. But we have, this template is very much geared towards behavioral health in the therapy sense, not so much in the case management sense. So there are certain fields that we will add things in that maybe don't necessarily belong in that field, but, you know, we'll add it, we'll answer it, and then when we have our audit, the auditors come in, they read our assessments, and they can see, okay, we've addressed this in this particular field. They don't really care what field it's addressed in, but it'll be there. So, and I think what I'm asking is a question for both our sides, right? So when I think about assessments, and I have to think about it now for what we're going to get for Dr. Cloud, because one of the biggest things that's happening with assessments that are not done properly, right? They're supposed to lead to a plan of some kind. Oh, yeah, yeah. I haven't gotten there yet, but yes. No, no, no, no. Stay with me on the assessment side. Your assessment, although you're using something for something else, is this a generic one? Is this something that would be in a database of assessment? Or is it modified enough where it's literally just kind of Montgomery County type of assessment? No, I don't think it's specific to Montgomery County. This is very much a standard behavioral health assessment. We, you know, I hope I'm answering the question right. This is, yeah, a pretty standard behavioral health assessment that you can find, I think, in any mental health clinic. The difference with us is we have some medical things that we need to enter. We have, you know, more case management things that we need to enter. Right. But this assessment, I'm thinking you can pretty much find these fields in most assessments. Okay. So, Melvin, I do see your hand. So, my question now is for two questions. One for our IT on our side. For all the assessments that's in NextGen and available in NextGen, not the ones that are modified, right? So, the ones, are we calling assessments templates? Is that what we're calling them? So, I use the same language. Is an assessment a template? Is that the same thing? Yeah, it's a template. Anything that captures data is a template. It's a template. So, okay. Is there a list of the templates and the type? Or if it's like an assessment, does it have a particular name? Or it'll just have BHCA social history? Yes, that template is the same. So, if I'm in the crisis center or any other place that is going to use this assessment, the template is the same. The difference comes in the specialty and in the visit type. This visit type is very specific to us, intake no medical services. And so, it'll give us specific links that are for our program. Not to say that any other program couldn't use any of these links and probably do. But that's kind of how we differentiate. Okay. So, for the templates that are there, that are some are assessment, probably some aren't. But if it collects data, it's called a template, right? Yeah. For all the templates that are there, can we get a list of those templates? And will the Dr. Cloud team do a crosswalk as to one for one? This is here. It's the same as this thing. Are we going to accommodate that process? And I guess this question is for the Dr. Cloud team more than our side. How would I know that all the templates that's available in NextGen is also available on the Dr. Cloud side? How can we help get that process done? Well, we… Go ahead, Brian. I was just going to say, we've got the forms library, right? And I thought we would need to do an exercise with the county to show them all of them. I mean, that's part of opening up staging site access to the people who are working on the build, is that we would have them review the forms that come out of the box from Dr. Cloud and tell us which ones would be applicable that you currently use. I mean, we can do that exercise together, too, over a call. But that's what needs to happen is a review of the existing forms. Forms are the equivalent of templates. Templates. And there's a lot of them. So, I'm trying to find… Yes. Right. And we've got thousands. So, I'm just like, okay. I'm trying to find the most efficient way to do this crosswalk. Charisse, do we have a list of our templates? And is there a description with any of them? So, if Joanne could open up. You know, Joanne, how you go to the forms at the bottom. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. These are all the templates that are in NextGen. Right. But is there a description of them? That's a description you would get. Yep. What you're seeing is the title names. And that would be the description. Correct. So, you would have those medical records, and there's a demographics tab, if Joanne can tap on that one. There's another tab at the top, Joanne. Oh, yes. Sorry. That's okay. No worries. So, yeah. That's what you would get. But I think to Ryan's point, folks would need to look at what's in Dr. Claude and see which they use forms. Forms would apply for the current workflow that we're moving to. Yeah. But we're going to be – so, we're not using all these templates that are here? Is that the assessment? No. No, because that was never done when we went to NextGen 13 years ago. Right. All the templates were made available, and no one ever really went through and decided what folks can use and not use. Because right now, Joanne can see all of them. But IT was trying to restrict it because there's some forms you shouldn't see because we don't do ophthalmology. We don't do fill-in-the-blank specialty. And so, it shouldn't be shown. But IT never was able to get that information from the practice to say, these are the forms that folks are using and should only see. Because then, we could have configured it to only see what folks should be using. Should be using. From the database, can you see the forms used? We would have to get a report from NextGen. If you can get a report from NextGen and with the name. I just want – We can try. That's usually done when we do an upgrade. That's usually a service they provide when we do an upgrade. But IT will ask to see if they can provide that report now. So, my thing is, the walkthrough with Dr. Cloud to do this, that is not another week's – I'm sorry. That's not another week's of work. That's not a day. That's going back to each program and saying, oh, here are the forms that we have. I don't know. I'm trying to see how much homework we can do before we do that. You guys get me? And that would have been great 13 years ago if we could have done that. I understand what you're saying. It is a lot of work. And that's the reason why it was never done because we couldn't get folks to sit down and say, these are the forms, the templates that we need to be seen. So, we show templates. And I just want to be clear. I just want to make sure everyone understands. Yes, we can go in and ask NextGen to do a report. I've seen the reports. And I know it's not accurate. Why? Because folks will go to something that's ophthalmology. We do not have ophthalmology. But it will show that it's been used because folks have gone into it and played around with it. So, there's going to be some false data in that report. Okay. But we will ask for the report. Okay. Ryan, this is about a body of work that I need to figure out how efficiently to get this done because I don't think I can call back 50 million meetings for us to go through every form and say, which ones are you using? I don't know. We just don't have the capacity for that. But I, okay. Melvin, I do still see your hand. In terms of the assessment data, Joanne, right? I know the narrative stuff. Okay. We can't really get data out of narrative. I get that. For the Dr. Cloud team, we can always modify the forms on your side. Certainly. That's what we're going to look at. What can we use out of the box versus what can be modified? Okay. Diane and Jamila, we're going to have to talk about this because I need to figure out how this is going to get done and make sure we have everything we need. Because even if the Dr. Cloud team says, yes, here's a form and the program says, yes, we can use it, but we need these two other things, that's a modification, right? And I don't want to learn that too late down the road. Right. Okay. Thank you. Melvin, sorry. Thank you. No, that's all right. I think that you hit on several things that I've been thinking. And again, just to go back to Joanne. Joanne, please clean up anything that I'm about to say. That there was no template in NextGen that met our needs. None. And so what Joanne did was to modify greatly the template. I think for the case management side is where this really comes into play. And so what she's showing you now is in a sense how she has put in the questions that we need to ask that makes us compliant in any audit for the assessment that we are required to give. I don't know going forward that, and this is where I'm trying to, whether the conversation I was just hearing kind of beats that or not, whether we could potentially, and Joanne's going to kill me if it's a lot of work for her, kind of develop a template that actually meets our needs without having so much modification to be done. She's modified quite the hell out of the templates in order to get them to meet our needs. And I guess that goes into the second point that I wanted to make. In listening to this and thinking about our program, we've got over 60 people who potentially could be in and out of this. As much training as we can get, they're going to be folks who have, and I know I'm not saying anything new, but they're folks who will pick it up quickly, but thinking about the modifications that we've had to do and what they've learned, and potentially thinking about what modifications, hopefully maybe just tweaking, that may have to be done. I think that for us, since we're seeing live bodies for treatment on day one, as much training as we can have to get folks up to speed so when we flip that switch, there are as few bugs or as few, because the last thing Joanne wants is 15 people outside of her door saying that, how do I? Right. And by modified, really what we mean is taking a field and used it for, you know, our own purposes, not what that field is necessarily for. You know, in next-gen language, it was called customized. We could not customize anything, so it was basically, okay, you know, we need to talk about treatment adherence. You know what? I'm going to just use this comment section in living situation to discuss treatment adherence, because, you know, I need it to pop out somewhere. So that's what we mean by kind of modified. We wanted to customize things, and we did do a crosswalk. We were going from a paper record to an electronic health record, so I did develop a crosswalk for that, and I worked with the Blue Novo team, which was who was kind of helping us with next-gen, to go through all that, which is how our RSR template came to be developed, because there was no way to fit these data points into an existing template. So that's how we were able to get that sort of put together. So Joanne, thank you for this, because I think what we need to do, too, I think for your situation, we're going to have a special session, and there's a reason for this. I just want to make something come to light. I think more than any other space, there's a social service and a medical service side that's coming together here, which is unique, and I think that's where we're getting, right? That is where we're doing all modification to fit a medical, but it really wasn't meant for that, right? Because it's social, right? So the Dr. Cloud team, and as much as we think next-gen, we probably have the same issue on Dr. Cloud, so I need to get some relief to say probably not, is where we have medical, clinical, and social services, and that model coming together. It is unique in some settings, right? We probably have one or two programs that match. Most programs are very distinct social versus clinical, right? I want to know, in your system, how would the combination of models work? Because I think that's the reason why we have this issue with this program, and why the template probably is modified within NHRPY to life. I have a quick question. I have a quick question. Oh, are you done? I'm sorry, Rishi. No, no, no. I just wanted Dr. Tien to talk to me about the clinical and social piece. One second, Jamila. Yeah, no problem. So Romesh and Chris, I'm going to ask you to chime in. I mean, I'm aware of clients being a part of multiple programs, and as far as the models go, you know, I don't know if it's a field thing inside of Dr. Cloud with demographics or a service code thing that's applicable across programs. Could you maybe address Dr. Nimbar's question? So we're talking about associating or having clients only accessible via certain programs? Is that what we're asking? No, so we have two models of service for the same client, a clinical and a social service, right? And when we say clinical, behavioral health, public health, diagnosis, HIV, all that, right? Very clinical. And those would be offered through different programs? No, sometimes it's the same program at the same location. Different types of services. Right. So say there's a handoff, right? Because we're an integrated department. So there's a handoff from the clinical side to the social side. So someone that comes in for this diagnosis, the available services to them on the social side is rental assistance, and then that's all that stuff. But it's on the social side of the house, right? But it's the same program. These are people just handing off one part of a case to another set of individuals, right? So you need that clinical diagnosis. You need all of that to continue the case for that social support for this individual, right? So rental payment, follow-up with that, follow-up with those things, follow-up with your appointment. It's on a case manager. And those would be non-billable services? Non-billable, yes. So the way we handle that is we basically, there's an enrollment into the program, and then within the program, you have your encounter history. And so all of those would be encounters. You'd have the clinical visits would be encounters, then the social service, services offered would also be encounters to track the information that's needed for those services. And then they would be marked as non-billable, but they would just appear in the same history as all of the encounters. So I'd be able to see all the encounters in the history, but then I could filter the encounters and say, well, I only want to see the clinical ones, or I only want to see the billable ones. So it's very similar to NextGen. Yeah, but I don't, but that's not social service though, but we'll have to work with it, Joanna. So one of the things I'm going to provide is what social service looks like. And so it's not, so social service is a case management model of an assessment, the person's current condition, and you're taking them from one state to the next. The same kind of thing with clinical, but their tasks. So when you say encounters, it's not the same model for social service, right? They're literal tasks and activities, right? That's not an encounter that you've got to work with the customer on to move them from one state of risk to another. That's what the social service side is. But you know what, Joanna? We know the lack of this complete association, so we'll work with the best possible model to provide this. One of the things I wanted to keep an open mind about is that this same social piece is linked to our case management service, because that's where it gets paid. Right. That's the other piece that you guys probably aren't aware of, right? Because the provider on the clinical side, we can bill, right? But say we have to pay rent for someone through that same program, we can't do it through the clinical system. We have to do it through a case management system. That's linked to our ERP. So even the case management piece that's in Data Cloud needs to speak to our social service piece so it can get paid. It's kind of a weird system. Right, because right now we use EICM for that, and any encounter from NextGen creates a contact in EICM, or at least it used to, but I had to do my own. It's creating cases, and it's really messy. Yeah, you're right. It is creating cases, and so we use that when it comes to payment, because that's the function that we use EICM for, is just payments. But yeah, no, I know what you're talking about. Yeah, okay. We probably have to do a... Joanne, we'll have to come back to you and your program to find out what solution we are going to go with for July 1st. But I mean, the best thing I would need to know is like, okay, what are the available templates and what needs to be modified? But knowing the boundaries on what we have available to us, we'll probably create a better workflow than NextGen. The Data Cloud will probably have something a little better. I think the template might be better. I just need to look into that. Jamila. Yeah, just a quick question for the Data Cloud team. Do you have already embedded Ryan White templates? Do you have anything specifically for Ryan White reporting or anything like that, or something specifically for Ryan White that's already done? Any chance? I'm not familiar with that. Is that an abbreviation, Jamila? Ryan White? It's a brand. It's a brand, Ryan White HIV? It's a brand that they have, but it's very specific to that. So it's not a standard for EHRs to have it, or for... Actually, it is. It is. It's a national grant. It's not a... Yeah, correct. But they don't have it built in a system, so... We can go with that. If you can share the template. Yeah. Yeah, so we usually don't always hear all the assessments and templates that our customers are using. So if you can share the link or sample with us, we can see if there is something in the system that is similar or the same. Yeah, and if at some point you could share the forms with us, I'd like to be able to go in and see what is available and what we can potentially use or not use. So I'd like to be involved in that. I'm going through this, and I may skip over something. I may be going through it too fast, and I don't want any sort of... data points or functionalities to kind of be missed. But yeah, anyway, that's for the future. So, who's going to send a Ryan White link? We'll send a sample of the template that we're using, but it is a national thing, and I think NextGen had it in its thing. We just didn't purchase it, but it's not unique to Montgomery County. So, if I keep going with this, I've got the behavioral health part of the assessment. So, here we would go to screening tools. So, there are specific screening tools that we need to use. Now, we have some flexibility as to which ones we can use, but we do have to get approval from our grant. So, currently, we're using the CAGE, Alcohol Screening Assessment. Then we're using the DAST, which is the Drug Abuse Screening Test. Then we're using the GAD-7, which is the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screening, and then finally the MDI-10, which is the Major Depression Inventory. So, those are the four screenings that we use. Once you enter it... Let me just get a quick one here. So, Joanne, while I'm looking at some of this stuff, this is client responses, right? Yes. Yes. So, the client is here. So, we are recording what they say? Yes. Yes. So, what we do... So, do they fill out a form or we ask them? We ask them. Now, we give them the option. I've got screenshots of this that I've put on paper that we can hand to them. We ask them. We have a lot of clients that do not speak English, so we go through it in their preferred language. Luckily, we have staff that speak multiple languages, so we go through that, and it's also up to them. They can say, I don't want to do this assessment, and then we stop, but we ask them, and there's many questions here. Right. So, this is one of the things that we're going to have to change. We're opening up to a whole bunch of changes, but a lot of the stuff we're pushing on the client portal side, they can refuse, because I go through a lot of this myself, and we can also provide the assistance to do it with them if they want to, right? But one of the things we need to reframe and rechange is we can't be putting in this data for customers. This is a lot of data. So, can you give us a list, and I'm just doing you as an example, right? A list of the templates you use, and the templates you use right now, can you pull? Will you be able to pull them out of NextGen, and I see the data fields, or do I have to see them? No, I mean, all I can do is screenshots. I can't pull it out of NextGen. Yeah, that's part of the problem with some of the requests that I know you guys wanted screenshots, but it will be so many screenshots that I don't know if it'll even really be helpful to see that. No, the reason why I, so we just need another session, because my brain is working overtime right now. So, the reason why we need to do the actual walkthrough painful exercise that I'm trying to avoid, right, is because I need to know which parts of these templates are customer-facing data, right, and Dr. Cloud probably have a template in the portal to push, right, and then we have a supplemental template on our side that answers the clinical-facing, the therapist, and the social worker space, right, their observation to this. I think that's also an exercise that we have to do as painful as that is, because if we do a one-for-one move, then we're moving a workflow right now that is very labor-intensive on the worker side for customer data that they can answer themselves. Right. I will say, though, and this is changing, and it will continue to change as the years sort of go by, but the vast majority of our clients are probably not going to be able to work in a patient portal, one, either because of language or because of just the inability to kind of function with sort of computer systems. The majority of the clients that we see are uninsured, which at this day and age usually means they're undocumented, and like about 75 to 80 percent of our clients are foreign-born. Okay. So, and I think one of the things we're going to work on the Dr. Cloud team for is getting the language, right. So, I think that's one of the things that's there in the RFP is that this needs to be in multiple language. I think what I'm saying, Joanne. Literacy is also an issue, though. What? You know, literacy is also an issue. And that is fine. The thing, what I'm saying is this is one of the options. Like this, we're not going to do this instead of something else. What I'm saying is this has to be done, right, because for the 10 percent of the 75, right, I need them to start owning their own data, right. So, and we're doing this in other areas with the same population of folks, right. So, there's this training that's happening. But I really need to make sure that the appropriate thing is being sent to the customer versus what we need to complete, because this is a lot of data. And the thing is, it's not just one instance of it. It's multiple instances of it. Right. We have to do it every six months. Oh, geez. No. Okay. Yeah. It's every six months. It's part of the grant. It's part of the assessment that we have to do. And when they do the reviews, they do the year-end, you know, audit, and they want to see the initial and then the six-month. And they look through all of that stuff as well. So, yeah. So, okay. Is it for all the clients that are receiving services under the grant? So, no. So, this is clients that are involved in medical case management. Now, they could be involved in medical case management and medical services. If the client is newly diagnosed, it is an automatic that they're involved in medical case management. Or if they have a very complex sort of treatment adherence history, then they're involved in medical case management. If they are only getting medical services, their HIV is undetectable, they have no other psychosocial issues, they don't do this. They just come to see the doctor, and our support staff sees them every six months for eligibility. And ideally, you know, you are only involved in case management for about a year. Now, we have several clients that that's not the case, and that may never be the case, but that is the ideal. And we have non-medical case management, which follows something similar, where their medical piece is fine. They have no sort of HIV, viral load suppression concerns. However, they have an impending biopsychosocial need. They're unemployed, or they are facing eviction, or something along those lines. And so, the case manager does then get involved. And we still have to go through a lot of these things. And then, when you're printing the multiple languages, there's a question about multiple languages. What is the exact requirement there? Are you just printing it in multiple languages? No, there was no inputting content in multiple languages. No, so the way we work with our customers, that anything that's customer-facing, everything is translated into that language. So, the fields, the data. Okay, and what languages do you currently need? Spanish, English, French, Vietnamese, Amharic. It's a top six. I can post them to you guys. Yeah, yeah, if you can post it to them. I'll post it to you. I think it's top six or seven. We have it in all our systems, customer-facing things. So, our forums and customer-facing platforms. Okay, so in the patient portal and the forms, they may be filled in English, but when they see it, it has to be in the respective language. Is that what I'm getting? Yes, there is some weirdness there, but yes, the fields would need to be in their language once that's translatable. Okay. But we can talk about that requirement. Let's talk about that requirement offline because I don't... We need to further define what that ask is, right? Yes, we do. Because right now, we support input in those languages, but we don't support translating things in real time. But do you support changing the document to be experienced in those languages? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's talk about... That's one of our things to talk through in our business meeting. Sure. Just a quick comment, and I'll put my hand down. So, I want to kind of go back to what Joanne just said and kind of make sure that I'm not opposed to having clients fill in what they can fill in. I'm completely supportive of that. But I just want to make sure kind of there's, I guess, an understanding of the population that we see and the expectation that the funders have on us. So, as opposed to someone going to social services to apply for food stamps or to even apply for mental assistance in our program, we have to fill out an application. This is, I would say, although it's not medical, it's more equal to kind of like that medical visit. There's an expectation there's going to be a deeper dive into their behavioral history, into their sexual history. And a lot of those conversations do go deeper. And a lot of those questions, a lot of the questions that Joanne's showing us, that there are deeper conversations to those questions, is expected that it's going to be a longer visit, is expected that it's going to take a minute to get to those levels. And so, kind of where the challenge has been, and I think the expectation is, we see a lot of folks whose health literacy or literacy period is not good. Their health literacy isn't good. And so, we will, and again, not to be a crutch, because we would love not to be a crutch, but they're just folks who are going to need some extra hand-holding, and some folks who we're going to have to, because of our responsibility, walk through some very sensitive topics. And those are done. So, we're talking about the medical case managers, not even the case managers who do the one and done, somebody helping somebody with their benefits or insurance. Those who are doing that assessment isn't an intensive assessment. And so, it is going to be a deeper dive. And so, I don't want to think that we're letting folks off the hook. We're choosing to do all of the work. Some of that work, just like the physician going in to get the information that they need, with the social workers, it's a very similar experience of extracting the information that we need in order to do a proper assessment that is comprehensive of all of the needs that they have. Definitely understood, Melvin. And I got that in the back of my head, trust me. I think we're going to establish a sweet spot, is what it is. It's not everything, because there's some questions here I wouldn't push to the customer to answer, because once they think they will stop, they won't even fill out the form. There are pieces of it that we can push to them. So, what I was saying was more of a supportive space. They've got data that, generally, that they can answer, and then data that we need to talk to them and help them complete. But in the end of the assessment, this is the other thing that we need to think about. This is their data. They need to get it back. Do we print this when they're done and give it a copy to them? We offer a copy of the care plan, which is done after the assessment. So, the response to the assessment that I told you that I don't get back? They can. Most of the time, they don't even want our care plan, because it has HIV all over it. And nine times out of ten, they don't want to walk out with anything that says their name and HIV on it. But they're able to. If they want a copy of any of the forms that we have them sign, anything that we do and complete, they're able to get it. So, again, for me, guys, I'm trying to figure out where we can meet people halfway. That's what I'm doing here. Especially if you have to do a reassessment of individuals, they're probably questioning it. But it's not everything. So, I want to put you guys' mind at ease. I'm not saying, oh, let's push this whole thing to a customer. They're not going to answer it. They're just generic ones that I would like them to be able to do. So, I'm trying to figure out where we can and actually also see their progress. Like, oh, you're not asking me this again. That's fine, right? Because you already told me that six months ago. So, those kinds of efficiencies is what we're hoping to get. I think for this, while we're at time, for using your team as an example, right? Ryan, what's the best way to walk through the forms for this? Is it that we, I don't even know where to start. Like, how would the Dr. Cloud team, because we can't just have forms for everybody that uses a form. So, how and where would you start? Like, how would you accommodate this? Yeah, sure. In our implementation process, I mean, we even have this spec down in the project plan. But usually during those weekly build calls that we have now scheduled for Thursday mornings, we want to identify the users that, and it could be per program, but whoever is going to get access will demonstrate the forms cabinet or library, if you will, and show the list of forms that are out there. They're also very descriptive. So, when you look at the name, you can kind of figure out what the form is, but you can click into each one and see a preview of it. So, we just need to know on the county side, you know, which weekly call we're going to schedule this for, which Thursday call that would be an agenda item for. I think it should be sooner than later. And then bring the right people into that meeting, and then we'll provision access for them, demonstrate the forms cabinet, and then, you know, they can go in and take a look and flag which ones that they want to activate for their program. And how this is going to work when we're in production is, so we'll build out the programs in the staging site and have the county review and reconcile anything. And inside of each program, that's why we're having these discussions, is to understand the workflows end-to-end. So, workflows to us will translate to a collection of forms. And so, when you're in production and someone's inside of a program and executing a workflow, they won't see all the forms. They'll just see the forms that they need to see for that particular workflow, right? So, I think step one, to go back to your question, Dr. Dunbar, is we need to identify the right people in the county per program that know what templates they're using. And templates and forms are synonymous to me. And show them where to access that in the system so that they can do a review. And I don't know, creating an Excel spreadsheet on SharePoint or some way to inventory all the forms that need to be associated with the various workflows inside of each program. That's what we need to get to. I'm just not comfortable with that first part of the process. I know that's going to take a minute. I'm trying to figure out like how to... Okay. For your space where your forms is, do you have a library of information you can share? So, at least we can say, oh, you know, just a list. We don't... It would probably be a description that we probably could look at. I know it's inside of the staging site, but Ramesh and Chris, do we have any export on the list of forms out of the box that we could share? Or does it have to be done inside of the system? No, we can share that, but yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you, Chris. So, I'm going to go back to you, Chris, and I'm going to turn it over to you. Okay. So, I'm going to go back to you, Chris, and I'm going to turn it over to you, Ramesh. No, we can share that, but... Yeah. Okay. We can share the forms as well, but there's a PDF that lists out all the forms, right? Let me... Send me that. Okay. And Joanne and I are going to have a conversation because I want to test a theory first. If we look at it and we go, oh, okay, so some of these are understandable, right? Then I know how to kind of manage this going into the room because I tell you right now, if we decide to bring... And not everybody's going to be Joanne, right? To bring someone in and show them all the forms and then have them think through like, okay, which one would really match their... They would have to need to do that before they show up in the meeting. We have to do some homework. So let me work on an exercise first and see what's the best way to accommodate this. Sure. I think the meeting can be more so us demonstrating and giving guidance on here's the forms and here's how to preview them. That work can be done offline. It doesn't need to happen at a meeting. Then we can come back together once you've done the review on the county side and just look at the output. Okay. Let me see the PDF and then I'll talk to Joanne and see, okay. I probably have some ideas. Sure. I'm just going to work with efficiency. It's just a lot of work here. I'm not sure how much more you want to see. I'm not even halfway done. So most of your flows right now is the forms and templates that you use, right? The templates that you use. Yes. Are you able to tell us all the templates that you use at least? Yes. Okay. I can do that. I can create a list of that on each side. Really the medical and STI side are pretty simple. It's the soap and stuff like that, which I can create that. And on our side, I can create a list of the templates that we use because we've got our RSR template. This is the one that was created for us, not by NextGen. Our own IT team created this. Some fields were taken from other templates within NextGen and we've got drop downs. Some were brand new that were created, but this is one that we fill out. There is another template for our STI side that was created by NextGen. So we actually paid for this, but this one has a bunch of questions and fields that were created. So this is also for a grant for our ending the HIV epidemic grant, which was new as of six years ago. But yeah, so that's also a new template. We've got the IAP, which is the care plan that we go through. Now all these templates, with the exception of this one that we paid for, we share with behavioral health. And when I say share, I mean, if the client has been seen by behavioral health, any program, let's say the crisis center, and I come in and want to do a new comprehensive assessment, I can see everything that behavioral health already wrote. And I have to go in and delete it or click this button, which sometimes doesn't work, and it deletes everything. And then I can start over, so to speak. But the IAP, which is the individualized action plan, our care plan, that also, that's why this program name was implemented, so that we could print out an IAP based on our location versus based on the actual use of the template, because we could have a client that is seeing a therapist that's working on, I don't know, anxiety management. But our goals are going to be geared towards HIV viral load. So we don't want to see or comment on the other goals and objectives and stuff like that. Also, for our IAP, we have to add sections that we manually type in. For example, for our grant, we need an after-hours plan. It wasn't something that could be added on the NextGen side because it would be across the board, and the crisis center, as an example, does not have the same after-hours plan because there is no after-hours for the crisis center. And our after-hours plan is contacting 911 or the crisis center, so it doesn't make sense for that to appear on their IAPs. So that's something we have to manually enter. We also have to manually enter that we've offered the client a copy of this care plan. That doesn't – that's not part of any of the questions here. So, again, there are certain things that – we have certain things that pre-populate here based on the comprehensive assessment. When we go to assess and plan, we add a need. That need then translates over. Is the need – are the needs a list of values? No, we have to manually enter it. There's nothing that you can select from. So once I add a need on the comprehensive assessment, then I can see it here. So I would click here. I would go to goals. Now, if I select physical health, then some pre-populated goals pop up. Now, if I don't select anything, then I can manually enter what I want. But here I've got some pre-populated goals. Sorry, clicked the wrong one. So let's save that. And end date, let's just put that. So the IAP is a standard form from NextGen? Yep. Okay. And same thing. So because I selected a pre-populated goal, I've got pre-populated objectives. This is actually something that we gave to NextGen to add in, but, you know, some of these are old. They need to be updated. And nine times out of ten, our staff sometimes use their own. They word it, you know, the way they want to. And then after the objective, I create the intervention. Case management frequency. This is based on the acuity scale that we do. And then either the social worker or the client is responsible. And then we have the check off of boxes. And then this, I'll delete this. I will add, you know, affirm. And, you know, that they received whatever, that they received the care plan. And here we add after hours plan. And then we print it. And we have the client sign off on it. Or just after this is done and we want, and the client comes back in for just a regular sort of case management visit, not an assessment, we have a contact notes template that we use. And same thing, start time. Whether we saw the client on site, the explanation of what we were seeing them for today. And then we add the goal that was addressed today. Here we may add an intervention, but what we add here is viral load, CD4 count medication. So we're going into their labs in the same visit and we're seeing what do your labs look like? Do you have an undetectable viral load? Do you have a detectable viral load? What's going on? Did you miss a medical appointment? We look at medication and we ask them, you know, hey, what medication are you on? Do they know the name of it? How are they taking it? Have they missed anything in the last, you know, whatever? So we'll add that here. Response, we have to add something that specifically says treatment adherence. That's for the grant. That's what they wanted. So we'll add, you know, treatment adherence was discussed during this, you know, appointment. And then the plan, whether they're coming back in a week, in a month, in six months. If we're going towards discharge, the discharge is a completely different template. And then we generate this document. And, again, all these, I'm skipping this step, all these you have to go through, finalize. We add our CPT codes, which, again, are just two codes. And some of these we will add the Ryan White RSR template that we have to complete. Sometimes we won't. It just sort of depends if there's any changes. I know I bounced around all over the place. I probably made it slightly more confusing than it needs to be. But there's, you know, we have to go through AP details here when we're doing an assessment because we add counseling details. So there's a lot of stuff that we've kind of usurped from other fields to add. We have a confidential social history that we add. You know, when we go to our assess and plan, we have our interpretive summary where we summarize everything that was done and care plan goals and all that sort of stuff. So our assessments are long, at least an hour to an hour and a half, sometimes more depending on what's going on with the client and what gets disclosed and, you know, where we go with that. So is this always one session? The assessment, it can be broken up into two, but it's usually one. It depends on the client and kind of what gets disclosed and, you know, sort of how they're doing. We have some clients that just, you know, they bring up a lot of very traumatic events and really can't get through a whole assessment in one sitting. And so we'll bring them back for another to kind of finish up. But that's the assessment, and the contact note is after. Not the same day, but, you know, after that, we have six months to work on our care plan and, you know, our goals within that care plan. So any contact with the patient after that would be a contact note. And, again, this RSR, even if nothing changes, has to get completed or updated every six months. Now, if I am talking to the client, it's a basic contact note, and they got insurance, I need to update the RSR. Right? I need to go here and say private individual versus, you know, no insurance. We have our nutritionist that also has her own nutritional template, but that's pretty standard. Okay. If you can, okay, so the next steps, if you create a list of your templates. Yeah, I can do that. And then we're going to see if we can get together and see the PDF that our Dachshund Cloud team is going to send. And I think if I do that exercise with you, then I can give directions to other programs in a certain way. That's why I'm sorry I'm using you as a guinea pig. No, no, it's fine. Apologize. Because I want to see if one-to-one, maybe the names are similar so it's easy for them to go, okay, these are the templates we use. So when we go into the forms conversation with the Dachshund Cloud team, we can go specifically to those templates. You show what's in there, how they're going to do. Ryan and team, how does that sound? Cherise, you came off mute. Everything okay? Yeah, well, I posted a question. I just want to make sure. Does IT still need to get a list, or will we just get the list from the program staff? Yes, IT. You still want IT to provide a list? Yes. Okay, thank you. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Joanne. Sure. It was super abbreviated. Went through a quarter, half of what we normally do, but trying to fit a bunch of workflows into an hour is hard. Again, thank you, Joanne. I think what makes this unique is because I think we're the only program with social workers outside of child welfare, behavioral health, and then I think the elder program that work a little differently than those other ones do. I think that we're kind of like just a little niche, and you're seeing what that niche is in working in Next Gen, why we had to make so many modifications because of what we do. Thank you, Melvin. I think that, yeah, that was important to note, the social piece that's trying to fit, the social square peg trying to fit in the wrong hole. Right, right. Because we still discuss medical things, you know? We're talking to clients about their labs, about their, you know, high A1C and just all sorts of stuff, right? So it's different from potentially a social worker in behavioral health, right, that's just addressing. No, healthcare for the homeless will have the same issue. True, absolutely. Healthcare for the homeless is the next one that has the same issue. That's why my wheels are turning. But thank you very much for being patient with us. Ryan, Neil, Chris, Ramesh. From our side, I've, you know, documented to send you the list of forms and descriptions, so we'll get that off today. Okay. We'll probably put it on the SharePoint site and just share the link with you in case you want to share it with others in the county. Yes. It'll be easy for you. Yes. Thank you. The rest is straightforward. Any follow-up meetings? What's that? Any follow-up meetings that we have to set up, Ryan, out of this? No, I mean, we have a weekly build call. Well, we have a management status call today and then the weekly build call. So I think we're in okay shape. We also have a bunch more program workflow discussions throughout the rest of this week and next week. So everything's been scheduled. Okay. Yeah, just one clarification on the templates that IT is going to be providing. We need to make sure that we get the correct and accurate ones that the staff is using as well so that, you know, you want to match them to the ones that are actively being used. Yeah, so we're going to do that work. That's why IT give it to us. I'm having conversation with Joanne. We check, check, check, check, check. We compare it to yours. Then the forms conversation is much more solid. Like, okay, one for one, here's what we're doing. So that's how I think we're going to turn it. But to Ramesh's point, I just, Joanne, I don't know if you still have your screen, but if you could exactly, can you pull up your screen just real quick? I'm sorry. No worries. If you can provide the exact naming convention that you see at the top in the tabs where it says BHCA summary, because that's how our report is going to come out. For the RSR, I think it says DHHS, RSR, something or the other. Yes, yes. And the TCS. HHS, HIV, RSR. Yeah. Correct. Exactly that naming convention. That would be perfect. Okay. Yeah, definitely. Thank you. Yeah, sure. And we do have a discharge template, but we can go through that at some other point. Sure. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day. Bye. Thanks, everyone. Bye.",
