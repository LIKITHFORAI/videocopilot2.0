  "text": "So yeah, so till when the winter storm is affected by Alapji. So you know to start with let's understand a little bit about the industry you guys are working in and the purpose and drive behind the company. So we don't involve with the other health departments only behavioral health mostly. So we have almost everything so we do general things like the billing, patient creation, account creation, all the that whatever clinic or county they needed. And I can also take into the demo we have so and I can show you our tool. I can show you my tool so let me take that. Just a minute because I got that access and I forgot to do my name. Behavioral health, we are more into, we are like a SaaS SaaS company, we have software like our proprietary softwares. Yeah, we do. You're asking with the competitors? No, no, no, like what are our like main products. So are we a service company or are we a product company? So we are a service company. I believe so that's a very technical question for me because I'm still kind of yeah. So generally we are most with the clinic so we use for as I said the clinic hospital management software so. So is it like they buy software, is it like a one-time cost for lifetime or is it more like a subscription-based? It's like a yearly subscription, it's a yearly subscription. Yeah, it's more like a contract. Yeah, it's software so yearly subscription and our website doesn't show that's all. It's more like a customized tool so every clinic have their own requirements so we customize according to their requirements. Yeah, it's not like we just buy, you can just buy the plan and just install in your computer and as a back end we help the support. So we do the customization. So recently we launched this revolutionary AI group scribing. So where it's just similar what I built but it's a more advanced one. So just one-on-one patient meetings is happening, the appointments. So the audio will be recorded by our tool and it can get retrieve all the data like like what are they trying to say, emotionals, like tones of the voice and stuff so. OK. Yeah and also. Are you showing the demo? I need a VPN so unfortunately I'm not able to do it. So I thought I could open it from my computer but yeah. But let's think about like this Alamjit, let's not have any agenda for this meeting because. OK, OK. Yeah, yeah. Let's keep it like a pre-flowing. Yeah, it's more like conversational. Yeah, let's talk about like if you find anything you can ask me questions. I'll try to because I'm also slowly trying to grasp the knowledge about this company because I'm started slowly involving. They started involving me all kind of meetings. Let me ask you know 100 questions and you know maybe you know we'll get something out of it. Yeah. So OK, you know and I will I will focus on little bit on the consumer or you know marketing side of it. So how do we, how do we, how, what is the process of discovery? You know if I'm a owner or I'm a doctor pre-clinics. A, what are the existing products available in market? And second, how I will get to know about our products? So I think the EHR softwares are very less in the market. I think they are there. I won't say very less, but they are very. Let me check. These are the questions also helpful for me Alamjit. Thank you. So yeah, RXNT is the one, the competitor. RXNT. Yeah, RXNT. Oh, my screen is not sharing with you. Oh, so sorry. No. And Dr. Krone. OK. These are the one. OK. And we also get clients based on the contacts we have. So example, my another uncle is a very big doctor in Chicago, so he tried to use his influence among the politics. So and that's how you get the clients. OK. And we go to the expo's, mostly we go to the expo's. We go to the, to just to describe our product. Yeah, that's how we do. So let's get into the LinkedIn profile so you can see how. Yeah, so. How do we pronounce the name of the company? So, Yen Softec. Yen Softec. Yeah, Yen Softec is the company name. Our product is Dr. Cloud EHR. OK. Yeah, this is how they go to this all kind of. What is this? CBHack and conferences. Yeah. And yeah, CBHack on these kind of conferences. That's how we go. And this is IRF. This tall white guy is the one looks after the sales and stuff. Marketing. Yeah, the marketing. Yeah, no, definitely. I mean, I would like to, I would like to reach him out and make you meet. Just not for this also, you can talk to him. So he's from Florida. OK. And he'd been working for a long time with our company and yeah. OK, so my second question would be. Is there any hurdles or, you know, have you observed anything which is top in a stopping our growth compared to competitor, you know, and in terms of, you know, outreach or marketing? Because, you know, if I see the Instagram, not Instagram, but the LinkedIn there is not much engagement or interaction or, you know, some interaction. Yeah. Updating our, we're just posting the updates. But what I am, you know, I want to talk about the point. There are a lot of corporate hospitals also, like, you know, a group which has 50 or 100 hospitals throughout the nation. And people, you know, they are, you know, they are, you know, 50 or 100 hospitals throughout the nation. And people from those hospitals are very active on LinkedIn. So it's always better to have a good outreach on LinkedIn also, where we are, you know, we are not just posting our updates, like, you know, this is where we went in. But how do we utilize this medium? Yeah. That is, you know, like, after looking at the page, I feel, you know, it's underutilized. I know. Yeah, definitely. I definitely I say the lack in the marketing much. I'm trying to find this is the guy. So yeah. Okay. Go on. Go on. So I feel, you know, I will also study the what competitors are doing. Do you have any insight about where do we want to reach? Is there any target? Or, you know, is there something, you know, we have been buying that, okay, next three years, we want to achieve some number or, you know, some number of numbers. So definitely, you know, all these questions, I'll just reach out this guy. And I'll try to make an appointment. So it's not about the company discussion, but also you can if you want, I mean, if you're interested, I can just. Yeah, yeah. Because, you know, the current day, you know, the company I'm working with back in India, so I work on the larger communication and, you know, larger growth part. So in IT, in technology, the team is called growth team. Okay, their sole job is to help them with, you know, a roadmap that, okay, we need to reach x number, and then how are we going to reach and then we execute it. Okay, so he was also like a chief growth officer, you can see from November at this hospital medical. Yes. So that is the growth team. So I'm also wondering, you know, like, how many people are there in the marketing team? Or do we have like a growth team? Definitely, yeah, these questions, definitely. I'll, I'll talk to, I'll talk to my CTO and also reach out this Albert and we can have a mutual meeting sometime. Yeah. So, you know, if you have any specific brief, then it would be better, you know, like, I can also suggest a couple of things like this is what ABCDE we can do. But you know, if something comes from your end, okay, this is our requirement, like for this next two quarters, we want to have 100 new lead, you know, new customers, which are not, you know, from a traditional funnel, or, you know, some XYZ states where our presence is not there. So if such prompts are there from your side, it will make our job easier and faster that we know what we are aiming for. Yeah, yeah, no, no. Yeah, definitely. That would be really good. Because even I am, I'm not the right person, probably taking the because I'm still learning as we are friends. Luckily, if I'm being in some corporate meeting right now, I would definitely get fired from my company if I'm talking like this. So without any base knowledge, but yeah, this is also a learning step for me. I'm slowly kind of yeah. So and I believe that you know, when you're working in the technical field, because I did my internship with a lead tech company. It's it took me one month just to understand what they're doing. And you know, then I and my boss was asking what are you doing? And then I explained to him, you know, sir, just give me one month at least know I'm I'm just doing my orientation about your services. Because it's technical. This is also like industry is new product is extremely niche. And we are not from technical background. Or we are not from medical background. So everything you know, we need to start from minus one. Yeah. But you are interested in medical field, right? Yeah. So I'm interested, you know, from last six months, I have decided, not decided, I realized what I don't want to do specifically with advertising and marketing. I don't want to get into real estate. I don't want to sell biscuits or, you know, soap. But I want to help, you know, take people or, you know, people who are building something for which will make the world better. Yeah. And if I can help them to tell their story better, if I can help them to, you know, present themselves, which will eventually make their ROI good. Yeah, I would I would, I would own my team definitely to bring in with us. We need someone like you definitely. But yeah, before that, I'll have to Yeah, I'll connect. I'll reach out these guys. What I will do, look at, you know, just give me, you know, let me tell you the date. I will do my research. I will prepare a small presentation of what areas we can do. I will do my market research and everything. I will come up with, you know, 25 page presentation with some mockups and everything. Okay. Before after. So I don't want to just come in with my empty hands. Yeah, no, this call is just like that. Even you and me, we both are kind of understanding the company. Yeah, yeah. But, you know, like that is what, you know, why? Because I feel first impression is last impression. And I strongly believe in whenever you're meeting someone, it needs to be that there has to be something concrete on which you can have a conversation. So obviously, I have some experience and stuff like that. But it's not relevant to the industry which we are in. So yeah, yeah. Yeah, let me share this LinkedIn. And yeah, I already started following it. All right. Great. Great. Yeah. I'll reach out to him. I'll talk to my CTO. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Alamji, are you working currently with an Indian company or American company? Like they have like a base in America? No, no, no. So the thing is, I'm still waiting for my EAD card. I had a couple of interviews last week. But I'm also, as I mentioned, I'm also planning to start my own LLC because I have few clients who are interested in working with me. I'm still waiting for 10 days if I won't get, I will pay, I will pay the premium processing and get my EAD card because I want to start my company as soon as possible now. So and for the Indian company, Indian thing, because my father is an Indian company back in India. So I just do and it's more like a consultancy only. I just need to spend, you know, a few hours a day. Yeah, it's just a night thing. And it's a good company. It's a publicly listed company. They are the market leader in India. What is it called Alamji? It's a jewelry company. It's called the parent company is RBZ Jewelers. Oh, you, your family own a, your father own a jewelry? No, no, no. So this is like the client. Our website is still, you know, it's under maintenance, but we have like, we have YouTube channel and we have a couple of domains. So you can like even search my, you saw my father and he was there. So, yeah. So, and because I have, you know, this loan also, so I feel, you know, I started working from last four months. So that, you know, at least that EMI, you know, is I'm earning from India and it just go to the Indian bank. Yeah. Yeah. So I do not need to, you know, send money from here. So, yeah. And it's a, it's a, it's a good company. Great culture, great people. Yeah. At least you, you are working Alamji. That's good to know. Yeah. Yeah. So that is, you know, touch wood, God grace. At least, you know. Yeah. No, Alamji, I would really, yeah. So maybe next meeting I'll, I asked for your resume. So do you mind sending your resume? Sure. I can share my resume and my website also. Like I will, let me just update a couple of things, which my career advisor recommended me today evening only. I will update and send it by tomorrow morning. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. So which, within that, so I can reach out to this, my salesperson and I can share your profile and at least we can get you as like, yeah. Thank you so much. No, no. I mean, you have to say thank you after anything happens. So I'm just but still you are trying that. That means a lot, you know. No, no. You are talented, Alamji. So we need someone like you. So everybody needs you. I feel, you know, it's sometimes it's more about intent. You know, yesterday I had a word with my professor, you know, and he was also like, she's very kind from SCAD. It was the, did I tell you about the SCAD thing, which I wanted to, you know, I'm meeting Paula Wallace next month. You told, you told that. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I share my plan to my professor that, you know, you know, that's, I want to propose and she was like, you know, don't get involved in SCAD, you know, they will just, I know it's recording, but yeah. Oh, wait, wait, wait. One moment. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay. It's okay. I trust you. It's okay. Let me turn it off. Stop recording. Yeah, it's done. Yeah. Go ahead.",
