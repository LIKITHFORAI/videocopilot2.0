  "text": "I wrote code, right, and now that code needs to go into production, and the question is what all should go into production, right? How do I clean up? There's a lot that I put in here. So, if you look at it, right, everything is being accessed through the browser. So, when somebody on the, whether it's a laptop or a desktop, whatever, they connect, right, if they connect to the Internet, right, okay, it goes to the web server, okay? So, this request, it will go, so this is just my way of showing that this is the Internet, this is the world wide web, okay, this is http, okay, whatever, www.documents.com, right, whatever that is. Okay, then there will be some folder here that says files, some images, and filename.video, whatever that might be, right? Okay, so this request, right, first this one, try to figure out the domain name, this machine will go and say who is my DNS provider, okay, it will go to the DNS provider, and this name is called a fully qualified domain name, okay? This domain name is translated to an IP address, okay, then this machine, right, the operating system or the application that you are using will take that IP address, okay, and it knows that this is an http protocol, so it formats the content accordingly, and then it sends it out on the Internet. It says this content or what I am asking for is for this IP address, so on the network it knows to get to this IP address, some route will be created and it gets to the machine, okay, it translates to a machine on the Internet. That machine has something called a web server, a web server's sole job in life is to serve web requests, okay, it will look at this link and say okay, do I know how to deal with .video files, so this guy will go config, right, and say for .video files I am supposed to go to this other component, whatever that is, okay, video processor, whatever you wanna call it. Okay, so this thing, it has some inputs and some outputs, okay, this guy will give the request to this guy and he will provide some content, that content is then sent back to the server. If this is a big file, then the browser decides, you know, whatever speed it has, this guy will say I will only give you 50 kilobytes at a time, right, because that's called throttling, so all of those things you don't see on a day-to-day basis, but you are impacted by those things, okay, so this web server is running, okay, on this operating system, whether that is Windows, Linux, right, or Mac OS. I mean, there are other OSs out there, but again, these web servers could be Apache, right, there's IIS, NGINX, you know, at the end of the day, people will take that code and there might be a custom web server that you've written, so on your machine, when you are running anti-gravity or when you are running cursor, it comes bundled with a small version of this web server, okay, that's why in your browser, so that web server has to listen to you. It has to listen, so that port 3301 that you are seeing, on this machine, whatever this machine might be, in this case, it's your laptop, right, okay, on this machine, the operating system is running cursor, cursor is saying for me to do anything in terms of testing, I need to launch this web server, this is where it's going, all of that is in the configuration file for the project, and so what port is listening on and, you know, what, where to launch it, where to launch the code from, right, so when it gets that link request, it's saying right now there is nothing else but this app to run on it, and so it's running that app, okay, and that app, right, that you see, the web app, okay, in your case, I'm guessing it's Python, in the back, okay, so, right, this Python thing, right, that you have, okay, it's taking the video that you gave it, right, and then it is doing further processing, whatever that might be, you know, like you said, it's doing chunking, and then, you know, it compresses it, and it does all of those things, and at the end, right, it gives it to some other process that is doing the transcribing, and some AI code is being called, right, where the transcription is given to that piece, and then it creates the summary, right, now, you may have had, you know, anti-gravity or whatever you were using, create these APIs that are running in the backend, okay, when you look at that slash in the browser, right, what's happening is, for that particular instance, it's saying, I'm going to execute Python, okay, that Python code is generating some JSON, and then that JSON, right, is being given to this React code, okay, that is running in the browser, okay, this JSON, right, and you download it, React takes a look at that JSON, and says, okay, I'm supposed to display it in this manner, and so you have that screen that you're seeing, right, all of this, upload button here, right, and then you're uploading the video, I think, right, that's what this is, right, and this is where you're showing the video, right, so this was your canvas thing, this is another one where you're showing two tabs, right, yeah, transcripts, right, one is the transcript, right, and the other one is the actual summary or chat, whatever they give me, the different chunks, okay, this UI is built using HTML, yeah, okay, in my case, it's React, no, React is generating the HTML, oh, it always is HTML, okay, there's nothing but HTML, okay, whatever you're running, the only thing that the browser understands, right, Chrome, in majority of the cases, now, there may be some custom things you can do, at the end of the day, it's a protocol, a protocol is nothing but a set of rules, okay, so it's HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript is for actioning, anything that you need to do, yeah, okay, now, there is two types that are happening here, right, this React thing that you're running, okay, it's saying, okay, when I click on this, what should happen? That's JavaScript, okay, where this button should display, what should the color be, what, you know, what font am I using, that's all styling, okay, so HTML, right, used to be called SGML, okay, so this is, the word is failing me right now, but it's called graceful failure, okay, so the way HTML works is that it's not going to, you know, break down completely, unless this web server says 500 or, you know, 403, you cannot come in, even so, you're seeing something, normally, what happens when an application crashes on your system, you'll see system error or something like that, browsers always give you a soft failure, they don't completely break, right, now, there are times when JavaScript will say, I broke and nothing else will run, but most, in today's day and age, most cases, browsers will say, okay, this piece of JavaScript did not run, it goes on to the next one, okay, so you ask me a question, what do I need to do to clean up this code that I put together, so I can deploy it in production, okay, so what do you need for that, we need an OS, okay, now, that OS in today's day and age could be a virtual machine, could be Windows, could be Linux, right, if you wrote code in such a way that it can be leveraged using Lambda, right, Lambda is just a function, right, but behind the scenes, Amazon is doing the work for you, so you don't have to pick the OS, Amazon picks the OS, Amazon picks the web servers, all of that is, you know, you don't have to worry about patching it, configuring any of that stuff, you just say, here's my function running and Amazon says, okay, let me find a machine where I can host this and run it and ship it off, but here's, it's like calling your cell phone, here's the number. And how do you give that, like my project file to Amazon, like they are going to give it to you? We can give you a link and if we give you the link and you go there, like if you go to, you know, right now we have Confluence running in the cloud, right, you are running it locally, you pick one of those VMs, it has Apache on it already, DrCloud has Apache on it already and so if you install Python and say, here's a Python.py file that needs to run, it will run, it will do, you know, you need to make sure, that's why when you write code, right, at the top you have all of those things, right, use this, use that or import this, import that, so what's happening is, when this web server gets a file called .py, okay, it gives it to a handler, okay, and in this case that handler might be Python library, so when a Python library looks at that file, it says, okay, this is not compiled code, it's interpreted code, so it reads it and says, okay, I need to import all of these things and then this thing will say, shit, he wants four things, I only have three enabled, the fourth thing cannot work, that's when the Python file fails, you will get, you know, include not found or import not found or something like that, okay. Now, if you have configured it to say, even if you didn't find the import, run it, it will run, okay, but typically when that happens, the web server is designed to tell the browser, I could not run it and when I cannot run something, I have been configured to tell you, it's error 500, that's why you see 500, it could be 700, doesn't really matter, right. Again, the protocol is a set of rules, that's why this has been leveraged so much and there are standards, the 404 means you cannot find, when you ask for this, the web server is going through and saying, is that file existing here, if it cannot find it, it will say 404, if it says, okay, wait a minute, this file, I am not supposed to give access to anybody, that's when you get the forbidden 403, okay. So, all of those things, right, again, protocol, set of rules and so the browser says, okay, I am not supposed to, it just told me, the browser is not making the decision, the browser is taking what the web server gives it and it's telling you, okay. In most cases, like, you know, what I do, I create a lot of security by obscurity, you ask me the same question, I document the errors that I am getting, right, but if you ask me a hundred questions and those are all ways of hacking into me, I will always give you the same answer. So, in our case, that's why when you go and try to guess passwords and stuff like that, IP address is restricted or something is not enabled with that user, we always will only say invalid username and password, because people learn, if you put in a username and password and say, username not found, right, to the user, they say, okay, that user doesn't exist, so I will try some other user, password invalid, okay, this password doesn't work, I will try some other password. So, that's how people learn, that's called behavior, okay, so in your case, what will go, right, so at a bare minimum, if you have everything in Python, that's all, that's all you need, you need Python and you need the JS files that go with it and everything will be right there. Back end is running on Python, front end is running on React plus TypeScript plus point. So, what happens to the browser, the browser gets the HTML document. Okay, now I got clarity. And I have one more question, so do we have any internal server to host my tool for now, just to use? Yeah, yeah, we have servers. So, yeah, I want to start with that. You know, staging machine, queue machine, you can pick a folder. Yeah, because I want to host my tool so that users can test it. Yeah, that's what I said, right, you know, if we can expose it, so essentially any web server that can host Python, you can put your content up there. Yeah. Okay, now in your case, what else do you need, right, you need some more things though. Somebody is uploading a 200 megabyte file, right, so whatever machine you pick, it has to have a temp space, right, because whether you are streaming or not, right, this thing needs to write the file down to disk. Okay. Disks are cylindrical, they've always been cylindrical, that's why when you say storage or disk, that's what people show. Yeah, the CDs. Yeah, so essentially what is this, this is just one CD stacked on another, that's why it's a cylinder. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so you need space, disk space, so when you pick a VM, right, now you start thinking, okay, how fast does it need to run, how much code do I have. Right, if you have one Python file, right, and there is 100 people that need to access at the same time all the time, and if this Python file translates to 2 megabytes in memory, right, then it's 200 megabytes is the RAM that you need at all times for your application. On top of that, if it needs to respond in sub-second responses, then your internet speed matters. Mine is, right now is a GPU expensive software tool. Yeah, yeah, so there is this thing called standard terminology in terms of where is the application bound. An application can be CPU bound, memory bound, or disk bound. In today's day and age, now they can be GPU bound because it's an important construct. So if you are leveraging GPUs, then you need a machine that gives you that kind of processing power, and so the faster you need it to be done, then the faster GPU will help you, right? So that's where you figure out which VM on AWS am I running, which Azure on Azure that I'm running, okay? Yeah, but the GPU, I'm slowly going to get off once I experiment with SharePoint, so then it doesn't need to get saved. Yeah, so here's the thing, right? So you're saying, I'm going to say instead of uploading, give me a link. Yeah. Right? Give me a link. So what happens, now you're saying this machine that needs to run, right? This thing now needs an internet connection to go out, right? It was uploading, right? And I'm asking something, I'm uploading, and then I'm receiving. Yeah. This guy now says when somebody asks me for something, now I need to go out. So people charge you for that. Outbound internet, it's called egress. Okay. Okay, I think it's egress. Okay, so this thing now needs, so depending on how big a file it is, you know, what connection it is, it needs to go out. Then that's where you have point-to-point rules. Okay? SharePoint says, no can do, you don't have access. Or it says, wait, you have access, but you need to do OAuth. I need an API key. Yeah, exactly. That's where authentication and authorization comes into the picture. Yeah. Right? So authentication is here's the API key, okay? Authorization is can, you know, are you authorized to access from this IP address? Is this machine, because this thing, everything has an IP address on the internet. Is this IP address, am I allowed to communicate with this IP address? This IP address comes from Russia, sorry. Right? Yeah. So there may be rules like that. Yeah. So again, so then you have to think about, well, what the code that I'm writing, and you say streaming, right? It's downloading frames, right? So the expectation is you're not storing much on disk, right? But then you're memory bound, because if you want to run things faster and not store on disk, then you need more memory, right? Each, if you're doing 10 megabytes at a time, let's say, right? That's why people do parallel processing. So you take 10 megabytes, give it to something, and then there's another thing that is downloading 10 megabytes, right? And then you're creating 10 megabyte chunks, that's sort of chunky. Okay? You take those chunks and give it to this process, right? It's all lines and boxes. Yeah. Okay? You give this to this guy, it goes to this guy, this guy might give it back from something here, that guy may go somewhere else again. Right? So that's processing. Yeah. Okay? Yeah, the next experiment I need to do is giving this a local hosting. No rendition or co-ordination. Same thing. Right? Yeah. Same thing. Put it together, upload it. That's it. Cool. Now I got it. Yeah. Now I feel like now I'm clear on a few things. This is a crash course in web technology, what you just got. Okay? Yeah, I'm using like source from, yeah, mostly JSON, JSON. Oh, yeah, did you stop the recording? Because it won't make sense.",
