  "text": "Summer, do you have a, or maybe Neil, like a screenshots or just a set of steps to access NextGen when once people are logged into the county network, sort of like an icon? Do you know, Neil? I do. I can forward it to you all. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. It's not me, but it's the four people on our team I am hounding to make sure that they verify their NextGen access today. Yeah. Okay. I can forward you the document that I received from Cherie. Perfect. Yeah. Just send it to the team, will you? And include Surya from our team. It should be on some of your notes. It's Neil, Chris, Surya, and Ramesh who should have the NextGen access. Okay. Yeah. She sent, she forwarded it on the email as well. I'll make sure they get it. I'll get the one that she sent to me. Thanks, Sumbit. Hi, everyone. This is Hadley. Hello. Hi, Hadley. Good morning. Or good, actually, noon, afternoon. Yeah. Right after noon here is a good, good morning, everyone. Yeah. I'll forward it to you all. Okay. Yeah. Just send it to the team, will you? And include Surya from our team. It should be on some of your notes. Yeah. I'll make sure they get it. I'll get the one that she sent to me. Thanks, Sumbit. Hi, everyone. This is Hadley. Hello. Hi, Hadley. Good morning. Okay. Let's see. I think I've got it. It should be on some of our notes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'll make sure they get it. I'll get the one that she sent to me. Thanks, Sumbit. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and start the public comments and then we'll open it back up to the committee. I'll make sure that they get the one that they sent to me. Okay. This is Hadley. Hi, Hadley. Hi, Sumbit. Hi, Sumbit. Okay. All right. So, I'm going to open it back up to the committee. All right. Thank you all for joining this meeting. It looks like we can go ahead and get started. And just for transparency purposes, this meeting is being recorded and this recording will be uploaded to the SharePoint site. I can, if anyone has any objections to that, I'll defer that to Dr. Nembard, but we can go ahead and get started. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. We can, let's just get started where we left off the last time in terms of the other tabs in the spreadsheet. Yes. I think today's focus is billing and some of the claim information. So, I've invited Sam Williamson and Hema Bhandaru from the Dr. Cloud side who are our billing and claim experts. Okay. Do you want us to start on the demo part of ours first before we go to the spreadsheet or? Sure. Whatever is most efficient for Nembard. We can start, we can start on our side. Taylor, are you ready? So, we're just going to do some generic walkthroughs. Yeah. Hold on one second. I actually think it would probably be easier if they start on their side to show what they're trying to pull and then I can kind of, are you guys just trying to see like a claim being created? Yeah. Yeah. We want to, let's just see what we do on our side and then we can, then we can have the other conversation. Actually, I'm going to kick that, Beth, can you just create a claim out of the test one that Zia Myer was doing on Friday? Yeah. You just need a live demo? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Give me two seconds. Let me log into PM. Okay. I know I'm going to get a lot of errors though, because the test patient is not going to. So, do you want to see the whole checkout process or just populate a claim? I think for this purpose, we just need to populate a claim. All right. So, you could just add a charge in and then populate a claim. Okay. Let me just see if any of these have claims that I can just, well, I guess not, I'll just create a new encounter. So, I'll just do like a Mayer group, or that's all right, this is already here, never mind. Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry, I should have been more prepared. I didn't know I was going to be doing this. So, I just wanted to say sorry. No, I put you on the spot. You're fine. Okay. Hello, everyone. Oh, wow. It went through. Okay. So, now I'm going to say, so I just created this claim. So, do you want me to go in and open what it looks like? Okay. Yeah. Can you open the claim? Thank you. Yes. Just let me know what you want me to do. So, that's pretty much it from our side. So, when you guys are looking for rules, are you looking for all the rules for what we have populated into each field of this claim form for each type of insurance? Yes. So, inside of the requirements sheet, Neil, please have that ready to go, you'll see that we're asking for information on, I guess, service codes and payer information and, you know, what gets pulled into the claim form. So, yeah. So, Taylor, correct me if I'm wrong, but these are our, this is our claim edit library. Do we just, like, want to screenshot which, like, Medicare and what Medicaid and, no, that's not a good idea. It's not the, I mean, that will be the start, but we do have some where we're pulling different MPIs where we did it within the insurance. Within the payer. Okay. Yeah. So, it's not all, all of our claim information is not just in one place easily to be pulled. So, this would give you kind of, like, the standard of what we're pulling into each, you know, kind of box, but then there are modifications based on payer, which are in the payer section. Does that kind of make sense? Yes. So, you're asking for us to consolidate all of that into one on this Excel spreadsheet that you're doing? Well, there's two tabs, right? So, the first one is the billing rules, and I think that is, like, what services get billed to which payers. I think there might be modifiers on there. I'm not sure. So, I'll ask the team to keep me honest and confirm that. Can I flip? I'm going to flip that open while you're talking, if you don't mind. Yeah, please. If that's okay. Neil, maybe you can pull it up real quick, and we can level set there, grab the screen, and let's go to the billing and claims. And Sam and Hema, if you guys can jump in with your, what we're asking for inside of this. And I think there's a couple hand raises as well as we're pulling stuff up. Yeah. Let's go ahead and do questions. Beth, can you do me a favor and upload that claim form into the chat for me, please? Are all the claim forms like that? Yes. For the most part, they're all that format, but they pull out different information. We've asked the Amara. She went and pulled and ran claims for all of our main insurance companies, right? So, our MCOs, our Medicaid, our Carolines, and she's working on the private ones. So, we'll have examples for each one. Okay. So, it's just a matter. And that's in a folder. We'll move that over to the SharePoint folder once that's done later today. So, we'll have an example for each payer as well. And then, so, yeah. So, not only this one here for this example, but we'll have an example for, I want to say, 60% of our payers. There's some payers we don't really use. They're just in there as shells, kind of like AARP, for example. We didn't run those yet just for the sake of time. Because we just didn't have the time to pull those on such short notice. No, the main ones are fine. That template, though, that is it. Right? There's no template based on payer. So, there is. So, there's a template for each type, right? Medicaid, Medicare, kind of is what Beth was showing with the claim edits. Yes. And then there are modifications based on payers. Some payers want to pull the provider MPI, right? Some payers want the location MPI. Or they want, what's the one we were just working on about a month ago, Beth, where we changed that thing for Kaiser? I think it was Aetna. Or Aetna, right. Do you remember what that was? Yeah. They wanted a taxonomy code that other payers weren't asking for. So, what we did was we actually first started with just Aetna, and then we ended up just putting it in all the groups so it would go over. But, yes, it was a taxonomy code that wasn't standard with other payers. Right. But did it find its way into, I think what I'm trying, Beth, one second, Chris, I know you're showing that sheet. Beth, can you show that template again for me real quick? Which template? I'm so sorry. The one, the last one. The claim file. The claim file. Yeah, the claim edit. Yeah, absolutely. Let me get right back there. Can you see? So, the other thing before this, Beth, the output. Oh, the actual claim. Yes, that one. So, this form. I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. So, this form is, have all the possible information, right? And if they need a different thing, is this form edited? Is there space for everything is what I'm saying. Is there one form, and as needed, we'll add data to this? Or is it a different iteration of this form every time somebody needs something? It's one, all claims go out on the electronic 1500 form. Okay. Yes. Except for dental. That's what I want to know. Except for dental. All right. So, in certain situations, some data is populated and some aren't, right? Correct. Perfect. All right. That's what I wanted to know. And to be honest, 90% of it's the same, right? It's just certain payers have certain tweaks, right? It's the 2% tweaks or 3% tweaks, if that kind of makes sense. Okay. No problem. I just want to know their problem. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Beth. Go ahead. Makari, I'm sorry. No problem. Actually, I think based on your question, most of my questions are answered. I just have one additional small one. So, is there any situation where you use specific rules or programs? I understand, obviously, different services, different payer rules. But are there anything that would be unique from one program to the other, other than just regular services and payer information? I mean, dental, right? Because dental uses, what is it, the ADA, I think it is. But for the most part, everything else is the same. I want to say, Beth, correct me if you see something different. Yeah, it's either the 1500 form or it's the ADA form, yeah. So, to correct myself, Rich, I think dental uses the ADA, not the 1500. Sorry. Okay, perfect. I forgot. We just added dental a year ago. So, I always forget. I would know that dental is special. Yeah. So, okay. So, dental would be a different template in this case. We're not using the regular 1500. Okay. Correct. Correct. Okay. I'm just curious. Would that be like a UB04, like old days, like style, like UB04? Like if it's a facility or it's a completely different thing? Sorry. Would you like me to just, while we're talking, just go ahead and get an ADA form? Yeah, I'll do that while we're talking. Yeah, no problem. I got it. Thank you. Chris, can you please walk the group through the columns and the information we're asking for and see if they're clear? And then if you see anything, Chris, Sam, or Hema, or Neil, that we're missing or would be helpful to collect and update the county on what we're looking for, please raise that. Go ahead, Chris. So, this is the billing rules. So, what we're essentially looking for is when there are cases that you have a code that gets added to a visit or a service and then needs to change for some reason, typically because the payer has a requirement, because it's a different type of payer, whether Medicaid or commercial, and then if there's modifiers that need to get added based on the provider certification or the parameters of the service, then this is what this spreadsheet is asking for. So, we're asking if there is a, first of all, the description of what this service is providing in that first column A, and then in B would be the service code that's added by default, and then the charge for that service code, and then the units, and then what should trigger the change. So, the change would be something like the payer is different, or payer is Medicaid or payer is Medicare, whatever the case is. And then what we want to know in column F would be the resulting service code. So, after we're billing to Medicaid or a different payer or whatever the case is, there's a change in the service code. We want to see that in the next column F. And then G would be the modifiers that need to be added or that changed as a result of that parameter being in place, different payer or different provider type or whatever the case is. And then if there's a change in the place of service because of the rule or because of the parameters of the service, then we'd be looking for that in column H. And then the resulting charge, if it's different, and then the units and how we're calculating the units. If it starts out as session-based and then moves to per time-based unit, so the units are calculated based on the amount of time spent, then we'd want to know that in that column K. And then any notes around what we're trying to accomplish with this rule would be what we're looking for in that column L. So, then I guess this is more of an internal question for Richen. We technically don't do this or have rules like this set up. It's more manual. You know, and this would probably fall more into, you know, I know Jitinder's made some recommendations for, you know, for drug court, for example, to use a certain code when they bill Medicare. And I know Joyce Bryant changes some codes based on when she bills Medicaid or Medicare. But right now our whole system is manual when it comes to this. Are you still looking to have that set up? And if so, it probably needs to go their direction. Yeah, I would want it set up initially. When you do your billing, for most of your billing right now, is it by units, sessions? Well, units are time, yeah. Right, by generic, right? Yes. And when you say bills, so just to clarify, right, we just push the bills out, right? It's the locations and the providers that are choosing whether, you know, what's being put on and whether or not they're using units. And then I only know that answer because we build the information into the system. So, you know, most of the system we build either 15 or 30-minute increments and then, you know, they can put whether or not they're using two or three units. Does that kind of make sense of what I'm saying? Yes. So that's why the rules would really have to go back to, like, your drug court. I know Jitendra's helped them with some of the coding stuff and what to use, but it would really need to go back to them because they're the ones that decide, you know, whether, you know, whether they need to change it for a certain, you know, payer or not. And then, you know, when we get an error or a denial, we'll let them know and they may go back and flip it. But it really does fall on them as far as what, you know, what they're using when they select the payer, if that kind of makes sense. Can I ask a very green clinical question? Yes. Both to you, Taylor, and the Dr. Cloud team. What is the basic code billing for some of these services as you've seen them now? Right. And here's what I'm asking, right? Because I think what I do, I want to start with the generic, right? So for, let's say group, we know groups are normally billed to Medicaid in this format, in this units of service, in this, right? So there's some generic policies around how to bill for certain CPT codes. Does that exist? Yeah. So it's not a matter of you can bill the CPT code to the payer, right? To all payers. It's just a matter of whether or not you get reimbursed for that, right? So sometimes Medicaid wants to see this CPT, right? Medicaid will only cover this CPT code, right? And Medicare covers this CPT code, but they do relatively the same thing. So it's not a matter of doing something incorrectly. It's just a matter of, you know, sending out the correct CPT code in order to obtain funding or, you know, to obtain payment. Okay. So let me ask a question a different way then. For the CPT code, is there any policy around the type of units that need to be built appropriately for these codes? And I'll give you an example again. We're billing for therapy sessions, right? Oh, for this specific therapy with this CPT code, the bill should be every 30 minutes, every 45 minutes, every 15 minutes, right? Or every 60 minutes. I'm trying to figure out if there's any generic flavor about what they expect the bill to look like for certain codes. Yeah, so Richard, to answer your question, so behavioral health codes that we set up, we have them like billed to, like units, and so like for, and it's based on time. So when the providers in the EHR, it has a little clock, and it says how much time did you spend with this client, and it's 45 minutes, that could be three whole units. You know what I'm trying to say? So that's how it, it's based out of the EHR time frame that they put on the clock. It's like a little calculator. Okay, so all right, so I think I have my answer, and I'm thinking, I'm trying to ask the Dr. Cloud team if they, if understanding these codes, because they're not new, right, and you've actually done this work before, what are the units associated with the code that's in your base development? Am I making sense? I'm not making sense. I don't know if we have any like default, because everyone's different, but I'll ask my team, Sam and Hema, are there any defaults? Yeah, usually there are two types of code, like one is time-based code, and one is like session-based. Okay. A code can be either one of them, not both, but it has to be like one of, one of the type. So when you say it's a time-based code, it can be a 15-minute time-based or 30 minutes per unit. So that's all can be defined in the Dr. Cloud feature. You can set it up. It's configurable, Dr. Nenbard. No, no, and that's fine. What I think, what I want to know, your understanding of the code and what's normally built is this. What I prefer us to not having to do is to manually go through each and every one and tell you. If, if, if you had the codes, and you know these codes are time-based versus blah, blah, blah, right, because of the work that's done, and I'm thinking, does that exist, is what I'm saying. It doesn't exist because different customers will say their, their particular code may be associated with the session, and that may be a different time. It may be 30 minutes versus 60 minutes, so that's why it's all configurable. Yeah, but time versus session is different is why, that's why I'm asking. Yes, that's different. Okay, all right. I was trying to avoid some work. McCurry? A lot of that, I think, though, will be outlined when we provide the, in the service codes that I provided, because I think there's a column in there for time interval, which we're trying to pull over into that spreadsheet. So, a lot of that will already be predefined there, and correct me if I'm saying something incorrect, Dr. Cleo. Sorry to jump in. I think maybe the question, if I understood, I'm understanding correctly, you're looking for general rules that we already have that we know about CPT code. So, for example, yes, CPT code can only be used for 60 minutes, and where we, you cannot use this for other, for a 55-minute session. Yes. So, rather than us, rather than you providing us with the whole list, I hear you. I think the question is more about the general CPT code rules that can be used rather than...",
