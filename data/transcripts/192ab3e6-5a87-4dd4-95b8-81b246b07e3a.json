  "text": "Good morning. Happy New Year. Good morning. I wasn't writing an email. Good morning. I'm writing an email for you, Summer. You said what? I'm sorry, I said that again, Diana? I'm writing an email to send it to you. Oh. I know. Okay. Uh-oh. Unless you want to call me in Teams after. Oh. Oh, okay. No, I sent it to you because it's like four different things, questions. Okay. Yeah, no problem. Good morning. Good morning. Hello. Hi, Becky. Hello, everybody. Hello, hello. Good morning. Hello. Morning. Good morning. Hi, Catherine. Hi, Ryan. Good morning. Hi, good morning. Cherise, how are you doing? Happy New Year. Yep. I know. Morning. Happy New Year. We're in 2026 already. Yes. Market set, go. Yep. So we'll give it another moment or two while everyone's joining. Good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I mean, it's the first day of the rest of the year. I mean, let's not get too enthusiastic. I text my team this morning and I was like, yeah, I had a plan for January and then I woke up. I'm just I've never wanted to see the beginning of 2027 as much as I do now. That's all I got to say. I know. Right, Nina? I'm like, yeah, I've given up, you know. Wow. Yeah, it's early, but I'm starting now, you know. I'm starting now. So a full team. Good morning. Good morning. Hi. So Mark, you're speaking. You're on mute, dear. I see. Thank you very much for that. Good morning. Happy New Year to everyone. Thank you for joining our first of our workflow meetings. These meetings have been set up to walk our Dr. Cloud partners, who is the new vendor for the new EHR system, through the current workflows that you all use through NextGen. So what we need or what is needed, I'm not sure if there's a designee or designated person to walk through the workflows so that there can be an observation of what is held in NextGen versus, I guess, to assess what the differences will be in Dr. Cloud. Sure. Good morning. Hi, Mark. How are you? Good. Just to start, since I noticed you're recording this. So the county doesn't actually allow us to record these meetings because they're discoverable. And so any recording that you can keep recording if you want to, but everyone has to agree. And I would caution everyone on the call to not say anything except for what the business operations are. Because any questions, any additional things that if someone wants to take us to court or something, all of this is discoverable. So the county generally doesn't like us to record these meetings. So I just wanted to put that out there. Thank you. I agree for recording. You got to say I agree. It's because the team's invitation came from summer. It's not our team invite. Yeah. But you still got to say you agree. It's still a county employee. It's still a county contract. And so it all still belongs to us. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. I agree. I agree. Thank you. So I just want to just give a little spiel. I'm going to try to see if I can meet every meeting before we start. And I'll be honest with you, I'll be at all of them. And Diana and I are going to try to tag team as much as possible. So on the HHS side, I just wanted to kind of set the stage for what these meetings are about. It's really tangibly about what do you do in NextGen today. It's not a wish list of what you would like to do. We're going to get to that later. And I know we've met with most of you before on business process. That is still a part one that's going to be very integral to your part three in terms of what you'd like to do. This discovery phase is specifically on every little step that you take in NextGen. So try not to miss anything. Walk us through as if you had a normal day at work. And there'll be screen sharings and things like that. So I just want to reassure everyone that everybody on this call is, you know, we've already, you know, everybody to be able to see the data that you're about to show. And please, please, please be as detailed as you possibly can. Thank you. So who, I'm sorry, who on our side on public health is going to take the screen share and data walkthrough? For the current workflows, probably Becky will have the most access to show. They want to see our system, Becky, and how the providers enter notes and registrations, schedule. Yeah. Hi, this is Ryan Phillips. I'm the director of the implementation team. So just like Dr. Neimbart said, just overall looking to get a walkthrough of how the workflows are set up within this program for the county, you know, how the users and the types of roles or permissions they have are set up in NextGen. And then when we look at the workflows, we just want an understanding of the forms that get pulled in for each of those workflows. And we can talk through, are there any special kind of completion criteria or supervisor signatures that need to be a part of these forms? And then I'd just like to understand with the team, are there any kind of integrations that we touch, third-party interfaces we touch inside of this program? And I think lastly, just any type of reporting requirements you have, whether it be like, you know, what is the patient population inside of this program look like for your operations, or are there any state reporting requirements that we need to be mindful of as well? So whoever can give us kind of the best walkthrough is appreciated. Dr. Ashford has a question. This was more for the team, for the public health team. Is it worth, not without getting too in the weeds, but just noting kind of what goes into NextGen versus what goes into Synergy, since our school, I know this is for school-based health, we use both systems? No? Okay, great. Thank you, Kate. Okay, sounds good. I appreciate that. Okay, so I am the program specialist for the school-based health centers, and I guess I can start. And maybe Kate and Brenda and Jeanette can chime in where you guys are. Let me just see. I just logged on to NextGen, so let me get to a good place. And my level of detail may be too much, so just let me know if there's things that you don't need to see or know. So while she's talking, I'm going to go ahead and get started. So while she's pulling up NextGen, I just want to add that we have certain regulations in school-based health center, the state regulations, and also the EPSDT guidelines that we need to follow that our documentation has to include. So just to let you know that those two sets of guidelines, and the COMAR, of course. Okay. And these individuals physically sit in the schools, correct? The staff sit at the school, not at the HHS site, right? Correct. So we have 16 school-based health centers that are stationed in schools, in 16 schools. And everyone who is enrolled to attend classes in that school are eligible to use the school-based health centers, regardless of their insurance. So typically, we have the packets go out to the families who are new to the schools, and the parents complete them for their students or children that go to the schools. Any uninsured siblings of those students can also go to and utilize the clinics. So once those packets are received by the school-based health centers, then we enter them into NextGen, and it's going to be via the chart. I guess I'll just start with a blank chart, and then we can go to a test patient chart. So typically, we look at the patient. If they're in here, then we… That's another thing, is since it's a shared system, sometimes the patients are already in the system, entered through another program like Rocking Horse Immunization Center. So that's where, actually, a lot of our international students come through that center first. And so a lot of times, the charts have already been started in NextGen. So if they're not in the system yet, maybe they're brand new, then we complete the entire chart. Anything that's red is required by the county. There's a few areas within the system that are required for our program, in particular, the school-based health centers. So like the school enrollment location is actually the clinic. So all of our school-based health centers are listed in here. So that is how the location is identified. And then there's also the actual school that they attend classes. The privacy notice is entered in here. Relationship role is where we enter the parent's information. So if they happen to have private insurance, we would enter all of that information under the parent that is the subscriber of the private insurance. UDS tab, there's just a few things that are required by the county. In addition, the school-based health center field right here indicates whether they have an active signed enrollment packet for the school-based health center. So we would enter yes. Once they become inactive, meaning they are no longer eligible to use the center, which would be if they graduated high school or moved on from fifth grade to sixth grade to middle school, then they would become inactive to use the center. The chart details, basically the only thing we utilize in this would be the medical assistant number. So if they have medical assistance, we enter the insurance in through here. And so all of that data is used when the patient is seen, checking them in, we check the insurance eligibility and all of that. And so that's how we create the chart. So I'll pull up a chart, a test chart, so you can kind of see. This is just a summary of the chart within NextGen. And then this is the actual chart completed. You can see everything. And then to go into the parent chart, you can also see this is the parent's chart that's linked to the child's chart. So this would be the insurance information for the parent. You have the UDS tab. This one has been entered no, so this one is no longer. This field actually indicates whether they show up on the particular enrollment for that school. So we track all of the enrollment for each school in the School-Based Health Center. So that's how we are able to report a lot of our data that's required by the state and grants and funding and all of that. This helps us with the enrollment portion of that. So a lot of the reports are based on that field. So this is the chart, what it actually looks like. And then to make an appointment for a child, let me just see. These are actual patients for today. So just keep that in mind. Let's see, we can, let me just make an, actually, I'm going to go to a future date, maybe tomorrow. Stephanie, this is for Gaithersburg High School. I'll just make an appointment and check it in for a child. Gaithersburg High School. I'll just make an appointment and check it in for a test patient. So we do well visits, we do sick visits. The well visits would be only for uninsured patients. We also do sports physicals for any student with a status of any insurance, sorry. Gaithersburg High School. Test patient. Okay, so here's the appointment. And check it in. And it's not going to let me because it's for tomorrow. So let me just think who I can do this for. I'm going to change the date. And sorry, I also need to find out who is not going to have any appointments, so I don't mess anybody up. Sorry, I wasn't necessarily prepared to do all of this today. Let me just, let me stop sharing for just a moment and I'm going to find the best route to go. While you're doing that, I have a question. This is Chris at Dr. Cloud EHR. How and where are you checking eligibility for these clients? So we, the eligibility would be, you mean for insurance or for the clinics? For insurance. So it would just be through the EBS system. It is my personal request to be able to have that link through the electronic health record system because that is the most, the most, the best way for us to use our time and our people instead of having to go through the actual website of EBS. NextGen did have it at one point and then it had to go away for whatever reason. So if it links through Dr. Cloud, that would be amazing. Okay, let me find a person. So you mentioned separate eligibility for the clinic. What does that mean? Is there something else that is dealt with that? Just the guideline of if they are a patient, I'm sorry, a student at the school, then they're eligible to use the clinic. So that would be their eligibility. Brenda, do you want to explain the eligibility process and maybe the care for kids also? Sure. So that's an internal decision and it may change over time. But right now, our eligibility criteria is any student that attends the school with the school-based health center can attend. If they're uninsured and they have uninsured siblings, they can attend. And then any child that is assigned by the care for kids program, and that's the county program of uninsured children that qualify for care for kids, they can also. So any student in the school, regardless of insurance, even if they have private, they can attend. Any uninsured sibling of a student in that school or some school-based health centers also have adjacent school feeder schools that can attend as well. And I think we have about four or five of those, six maybe total, adjacent schools that can attend. And then any assigned outside the school care for kids client, so they can attend other schools that care for kids program assigns them to us, they can attend. So you're just verifying enrollment then, and how are you doing that? So at the school level, they can check students through the Synergy system if they're attending that school. Care for kids sends a monthly list of any children that they assign. And then they verify siblings when the families join. They do packets for all of them. Great, thank you. Okay, I'm almost there, sorry, bear with me. Okay, I'm almost there, sorry, bear with me. Okay, I'm almost there, sorry, bear with me. Okay, let me share. So sorry, I'm almost there, I promise. Take your time, it's good. Okay. Okay, Kathy McCoy is not in work status today so I had to add her to the schedule today so that my test will work. Okay, so I'm going to make a new appointment for the test patient. So you can only schedule appointments when the providers are marked as available in the system? We can make appointments, but I'm not sure that they have full functionality if they're not on the schedule. So that's provider specific, we have other students that see nurse only visits. And so then we would go to their schedule and put them on there. Okay, so here is our appointment. I will now check it in. This was grayed out before, so. All right, so this is the first screen, you're basically just confirming the rendering and the location. Okay. And it's going to check it in and that's all the way this appears on the schedule is based on everything in the preferences. So we're just basically going through the auto flow process and it takes us through each different page that we need to verify information. So this child goes to Odessa Shannon, even though it's a test patient. Gettysburg Elementary is the school based health center where the child is being seen. This is the UDS tab again. This says no, but we can actually see the patient even if they are not enrolled, though we don't typically do that. Auto flow. And again, just verifying if they have medical assistance, we would verify the insurance prior to the appointment check in. So all of our this is going to be really the most important screen during the check in and check out over here is going to be the insurance listing on the chart. And then on the side is what we're selecting for this particular encounter. So for all of our test patients, we just add non-billable for the sake of simplicity for the fiscal team. And then it's just auto flow and that's it. It is checked in. This is a fee ticket that we do not use. So we just X out of that one. Becky, is the reason that you are adding non-billable because the visit is a case management visit? Or because the patient or because the patient don't have an insurance? What's the first? Is this a case management visit? The one that you're doing now? No, this is what did I say? A physical, I think I said. She was asking why. Why did you make it non-billable? Correct. Non-billable just because it's for fiscal for all of the just because it's a test. Yes, so typically we don't do. So typically the only thing we use non-billable for would be a test patient where we're just testing the system. Or there is one other instance that school based health center would use that. And that would be if it's a confidential visit, then we would add non-billable. And then no insurance billing occurs for that. Did I answer your question? Yes, because that will that will show Dr. Cloud at two different times when you are selecting that. OK, great. OK, so this is checked in. And now we will go over to the EHR side and look at the appointment for Kathy McCoy. So this is the inbox that populates. The providers will have an extra tab here for the provider action queue where all of the tests come in for them to sign off on. Or if they have pending items, they need to sign off on like a master document. For me, obviously, I'm not a provider, so I do not have that tab here. These are all the appointments listed. For the providers today. So we're going to look for McCoy. Which is only one right here. And to double click on it to open up the chart within the EHR system. So the top banner gives you the summary of the chart, the demographics and everything. And then over here is going to be the patient history. Where all of the encounters are listed. So, again, this is a test patient. So there's all kinds of testing appointments here. Just for a little explanation for the school based health centers, we label any visit that the provider determines is a confidential visit, meaning anything for reproductive health and those kinds of visits. So we would label that confidential. And then there is a report that I run weekly, actually several times a week, to be sure that those are all non-billable. And then we also have enabled the sensitive encounter. So this little explanation here is what will make it confidential. Just to demonstrate that, I will just quickly show you. So to make it sensitive, you would add this and the provider would do this. And then also enter. Okay, so it's labeled. And now that it says confidential in the remark, it will show up on my report on the PM side. So the first thing that the providers and the nurses do, or sometimes the medical assistants, they'll come to the templates and they will do their intake. And this is asking, so our specialty is pediatrics and the visit type is going to be office visit. If it's a nurse visit, obviously we would do nurse visit. The other option here would be for the providers when they are doing well visits. This has to be well visit, and that determines their series of coding that is available to them in the finalized stage. So for the follow-up visit, it's just office visit. So typically you come in for, the nurse will do the intake comments here. And just as a, you know, to briefly show you, then they can do their, whatever the follow-up is for. Maybe they previously had ear pain and it launches this. Typically the nurse is not going to complete this piece of it. But if it's the provider doing it themselves, then they could enter all of this information. And this gives the reason for visit. The next item would be the vital signs, to enter the vital signs. Hi, Becky, quick question. Inside of these screens, is everything required generally read? Yes. I mean, yeah, anything that's read. But I don't think there's typically too much that has read on the EHR side. That's all going to be mostly on the demographic side. Yeah. That would actually be amazing if there was that function for providers to say that they had required fields that needed to be done. That would be useful for them, perhaps. But I don't want to speak for them. They might want to give their own recommendations. No, yeah, that would be great because we get chart audited for requirements by the state. So, yeah. And I can link the EPSDT requirements if you need me to in the chat field. Whenever you're ready for those, we can send those. Yeah. Yeah, Neil and Chris, let's kind of make the note to review what fields they want to make required. Yeah, Brenda, you can send that whenever you want. Okay. Okay, so vital signs, medications. Honestly, I would recommend that we do another meeting with one or two of the providers that we typically help with our testing so that they can really go through the nitty-gritty of the histories and all of that data that they require, again, with the EPSDT guidelines that they're very fully aware of. So that might be really useful. So I can kind of give you the parameters here of what we do. And then, again, a more detailed would be better done with a provider. Brenda, do you think that's a useful suggestion? Yeah, when we're ready to delve down into it, and it would be good to get their perspective. Initially for setup, we probably, I mean, it still would be good to have a provider on the panel. Yeah. So typically they go through all of the different items, depending on whatever the visit is for, the orders, if they have any recommendations for what they see. And then once they're finished, this is just the intake. So we would generate the intake note. When the provider has completed all of their documentation, then they would run their master IM in the finalized. Let's just go. So in their soap. OK, one more thing to add while Becky's showing you this, we see children's children ages three to 18 for all of the school based health centers. So children. So when I send the EPSCT guidelines, the requirements are from age three through 18, not the birth or three to zero to three years old before that. So it starts at three to 18. So this is just for demonstration purposes. Obviously, I'm not a provider, so. So once they've entered all their clinical documentation, then they would come to the finalized. And they can generate the code or they can also override it and select their own coding. So this suggests a code, and if they believe that that's correct, then they can just submit that code or again, they can select their own coding for it. So once the code is submitted, then the master document generates. And then once this generates, it just has a summary of everything, and this is the principal legal document that is used as the electronic health record. So if any documents are requested, this is what we would print or forward. And then it says who's generated and who the provider is. Typically, this would match. It would be the same. The provider is the one generating the document. And then they would sign off by checking this checkmark and it adds the electronic signature. And this, of course, says I did it on behalf of Kathy McCoy. So that is the legal document you see here. And then we can check the super bill to see what charges were added. So that is something that they always do. And then this is ready for checkout on the PM's side. The last thing maybe to show you is that now this says chart complete. Once the provider signs off on it, on the master document, it changes the status to chart complete. So then to go over to the PM's side, to the appointment, and we would just check it out. Click and check out. And again, you just go through the auto flow process. And this is the second opportunity. Maybe it became, if we had insurance selected here other than non-billable, we could change it to non-billable if need be, which since I labeled it confidential, it would be non-billable. And then we are accepting. If you click on reject, it severs the communication for this encounter. So we typically tell everyone not to reject it. If they're not sure what to do here, if they're confused, they can exit or close and it will not sever it. But if they click reject and it severs it. But typically they want to process. And that continues the bringing over of the charges. And then this highlights everything for that particular charge. It says Keisha Davis because I had Keisha David as my preference provider. So I can change this to McCoy. And save it. Becky, can I ask a quick question? Sure. Is Keisha Davis the preference provider because as the health officer MD, she has to sign off on everything? So, no, typically anything I do administratively is kind of I have to have someone selected. So I select Keisha Davis. But for our nurses, they operate under Keisha Davis for the standing orders for the immunizations, which is all on file and, you know, able to refer to. So that's for the immunizations and then the standing order medications, the Tylenol, ibuprofen, antihistamines that are given by the nurse in the schools based on the standing orders only. And also my location says Broad Acres because that was what I had selected. So I can actually change that to Gaithersburg Elementary, which is what it should have been. So this is something that the nurses and the MAs typically will review. Also, when they're checking out, when the charges screen populates, they can review everything. The diagnostic codes, the place of service, the location and the rendering. So all of that should be reviewed. And then just auto flow through this screen as well. And then it is completed once you get the flag there. So that is a very brief how to enter a chart, how to make an appointment, check it in, do the visit and then check it out. Are there other things that you would like me to demonstrate? I don't know, Chris or Neil, I was looking at our life cycle of care diagram. I mean, that was pretty informative from scheduling to creating the chart. Do we have any other questions? Chris, Neil? I think in terms of the flow, no, but I think, I mean, unless Neil, you have something. But, I mean, obviously we are going to want to know all of the different types of visits you guys are performing along with all of the forms you're completing for those visits or the information you're capturing for those. We can use our requirements scattering sheet for that, right? Yeah, I think so. Can I ask, Becky, I don't know if you've given this to them, but the next gen manual we have for the actual user side, would that be helpful? You mean the next gen one or the book of guides? Or both? I can't remember which is which. So the book of guides is the one that I compiled and then there's also. That one. That's the one, okay. I have not shared that with anyone that I believe, other than the people that I use it with, and it's at each of the sites, but I'm happy to share that. Yeah, this is a training manual Becky has compiled that puts together step-by-step instructions for anyone who's new for how to do everything that someone would do in next gen on the nurse side, not on the provider side, correct? It actually does have a lot of the provider information as well, but it could be bolstered probably by conversations with the providers. Yeah. Yeah, that's helpful. You mentioned interns are able to enter data and nurses in a certain section. Is there a requirement for the provider to sign off? Or I'm not understanding the question. Interns? Yeah, we're an intern with inter data. Does the. provider have to sign off on any kind of entry that they put in I guess I'm confused by your term intern Brenda are you familiar with what I mean we have are you referring to no I think he yeah so I think he's asking about medical assistance if they're documenting and nurses if they're documenting our providers required to sign off on their nose so not for the nurses no so the nurses have their standalone visits like I said earlier the standing orders given the medications and the immunizations the nurses can do solely on their own based on the direction of those standing orders did you say that you guys you you pull some data off the confidential visits we hold data no you know data of like oh cool data well yes I mean we can pull data from anything basically that's entered based on coding typically that's how we would get it there is a report that I run for the confidential visits that's just simply is built around the remark confidential so so I know to add or I know to check to be sure they're all non-billable that's probably what you were thinking yeah specific for non-billable yeah specific to confidential okay yeah you said there's a web portal that data can be entered in that pulls into next gen for now or something for what for enrollment for new patients the synergy they're not connected no so there are some other things that need to be connected to our documentation and that would be like emunet the state database emunet they we send anytime we give a vaccine it sends information to that database labs it has to go back and forth to get results to order and then get the results and so that would be state lab quest lab and EBS we used to use to check eligibility I think there's some pharmacy connection and faxing capabilities and also I don't know where we are with Chris but we're uploading him to upload information into the Chris system I don't know how far we got with that with the next gen but so those are some of the other platforms that need to be connected is there any that you can think of Becky that I didn't mention I think that's pretty much it the EBS the labs emunet emunet does come into next gen and goes out so that's a two-way interface now yeah in the labs again okay I think that's all I wanted to ask is lab ordering done inside of next gen or are you going to like the lab core and quest sites to do it it's all it's all interface the state lab and through quest is what we use for the school based health centers but I believe other County programs used you're muted Brenda what is the other lab core lab core thank you make sure I wrote this down right also sorry Ryan the care for kids it's a that's a packet they send to you right a physical package it's a list a spreadsheet every month oh she's a spreadsheet okay you so the care for kids is the eligibility for that is done in our case management system yeah yes by a different program Neil which moving forward you know when I'm Becky wouldn't need to get a list you'll just get it directly from the system right now it doesn't speak that's why but it's it's still done internally in HHS by a different program so for the eligibility piece of that happens in EICM but the assigning of those students to their school-based health centers occurs at PCC so the spreadsheet actually says yes they're eligible but they're going to be assigned to you so that wouldn't necessarily happen in the EICM yes the assignment piece yeah we're still working out what that's supposed to be we come in to connect and all stuff yeah yeah so I maybe just would like to add of course at some point the reporting portion of dr. cloud would be definitely interesting to see from you guys to make sure that that all aligns with you know the the reports that we currently run to be sure that everything is entered correctly and we're seeing everything we need to see sure understood thank you well uh we'll do a review of all the reports that you you have and we'll kind of circle back with questions but we'll try to stand all those up inside of dr. cloud so you can look at them yeah that'd be great in your staging site yeah sure yeah Neil and Ryan this is Cherise I just wanted to clarify that correct we do have Immunet and it is a bi-directional but the faxing is just outbound there's no inbound faxing at this time thanks okay yeah thank you that the um we requested outreach for the lab interfaces we have the bi-directional with lab core done it's the quest one and potentially the Immunet one that we need to start on right away because there's a qualification period there and that sometimes takes months so we're trying to track to a go live date at the end of June which is why we're asking if we can do results only inside of dr. cloud to make go live and then do the ordering after go live but um we'll circle back with the group with what timelines look like as soon as we find out and how about the state lab we have not stood that up yet so we've got outreach to the state lab asking if they do have bi-directional available um and our chief product officer is on top that one so we'll follow up with you but outreach has been initiated yes and crisp we have we have an integration so that's straightforward ryan can you do me a favor for um our next meeting some of these standard things across the board you think you can post it standard so the connections that you've already made the stuff that you reached out to like you know because all programs are going to be asking the same things so if you if you can just do and i can pop it in someone can pop it into the meetings so we know you know that that'll be helpful sure we can put a spreadsheet together we'll put it out on sharepoint and then we'll pull it into these meetings perfect thank you and then also if you wanted to include some of the providers for a future meeting to delve deeper into what they actually are entering for their various different appointments yeah i think that would be helpful maybe in between there our team can um kind of tidy up and firm up the requirements gathering spreadsheet so we pass it back to you and we're asking the right information to capture that will enable us to continue to build out the staging site and i think with the data inside of the staging site then it would be useful to have we don't need at all but just enough of it so we can pull the providers in and have a meaningful discussion yeah perfect and also um probably from behavioral health also and the the various programs within the county because everybody does something a little different so i wrote down something called rocking horse immunizations i'm not sure what that is is that related to eminent so it's under school health um and it is um solely for immunizations it's centered at the international office so students coming in internationally can they go through the mcps process montgomery county public schools on the education side and then they also can visit the immunization clinic where they can have all of their immunizations evaluated for whatever their needs might be to enter school okay so if they do that then rocking horse probably reports it to eminent so you guys would be able to pull it down from there yeah okay yeah and then we built once they come to the schools then they are we build on those immunizations whatever else is required after that time frame of each immunization that's required okay thank you so um sorry ryan it's okay i was just going to say if there's any other questions from the dr club team but please go ahead so one of the things i i was wondering if um so sometimes when we send this information right so i've seen a spreadsheet um we have to situate that the the they're they're in uh next gen it doesn't always translate right so if whatever we're asking of the team they're you get me right i'm trying to say it but like yeah the columns that we're asking for may not be the same term yeah as they're yeah yeah yeah that makes sense as late as you possibly can put it out like you know like okay so yeah it'll be great because one of the spreadsheets that i saw i was hoping that we can get some of that information from these meetings because it's not one-to-one translatable and you'll have a lot more churn and a lot less information back so um i'm kind of directing people like if you don't understand let's see if we can move to the meeting to get some clarification but just to keep that in mind that when you ask for information it it's somehow it has to relate to to how you think next gen looks and the type of information so they're probably not familiar with just the one-to-one translation just to keep that in mind understood yeah that's helpful i mean i think as we go through these meetings we get more clarity on that so we can put better examples in but we'll take a shot at it internally today okay trying to put what we're asking for at least that way people will say oh they're asking for a location not a physical facility for example right right okay noted summer where is the latest sheet is it sitting on the sharepoint site with the county i'm sorry what sheet the latest requirements gathering sheet just want to make sure we're working off the same centralized copy give me a second and i can confirm that for you okay i saw something that was sent to to billing i don't know if it's that sheet well we could talk about in our meeting tomorrow i just want to be i want to get you back the information as efficiently as possible and that might be a little difficult for folks to get you what you need understood yeah we'll work on the mapping of the the terminology the column headers etc but um my concern is there was a couple versions of the sheet out there so i just want to kind of streamline that right now so i don't want to get into too much detail but there so i just want to kind of streamline that right now so we don't miss anything or people are working off different versions right okay yeah we can sort that out offline and we have a few minutes left so dr cloud team i think we have some investigation to do um are there any like test clients that are set up in next gen i mean i know our team only has um the only rightfully so but still want to be very mindful and careful of what we're looking at inside the next gen is there anything recommended that we should look at or i'm not sure what the maybe mark has a say on this but um i typically use um test female child and test male child test being the last name first name being female child and male child okay yeah um sharice had set up the test subjects in next gen there's like four or five of them right sharice um i think i believe there's seven and then others you'll see other about 30 or 40 other tests records um ryan but the ones that have like female and male and child and pregnant um female those are the ones that were set up by it great so it's pretty safe to say if we search on test we can work with those clients correct and i can get you a list of the names to you by tomorrow okay thank you you're welcome i just wanted to make note also that um our teen pregnancy program in school health services in addition to school-based health centers rocking horse road with the immunization clinic and then teen pregnancy also uses a component of next gen and i'm not sure if that's the plan with dr cloud or not but i just wanted to make that note also that there's a teen pregnancy portion that's not related to school-based health centers just like the rocking horse portion that's not related to the school-based health centers um that i'm not sure if we'll continue or not sounds like that's a county organizational decision needs to happen you'll let us know yeah i mean ideally it should continue um because it would be great for those clients to be accessible also by our maternal and child health programs who use next gen so um yes is this like a registry or where is this data sitting for the teen pregnancy so it's basically uh well uh with regards to school-based health centers we are just using the charts um and then the nurses document what they need to document and there's no billing that occurs from school-based health centers for those programs and brenda do you want to add something yeah so then in addition each school health services nurse has um they can select their school and put the information that's required in next gen and it's not indicated that it's a school-based health center that it's just a regular school and then it communicates with the maternal child health program community programs etc so it's under the individual schools are these considered sub programs or are they a separate thing that's a good question each school is listed as in next gen each school is listed as a separate program um or location yeah yeah i just confused myself so yeah there it's either a program or it's a location i can't remember how we set that up um but yeah each high school and each middle school um is a separate location that way the nurse that's in charge of the program is in charge of set that up um but yeah each high school and each middle school um is a separate location that way the nurse that's assigned to their schools um if there happens to be a pregnant child they're um pregnant student there um that they um that they have access and can enter the information there um it's generally the same templates um and same information that's being done um through our maternal child health programs um which i'm sure there's a meeting set up for them um in in your future um but it's it's a lot of the same workflow that happens with them will happen with our maternal child health nurses okay um summer and ryan someone is asking if they can have access to upload a file because they want to share documents upload in the chat yeah summer it's your meeting you'll have to well i can email it i can email the enrollment to all as well that's easier yeah well there's a sharepoint site out there if you want to put it someone send me that that'd be great okay katherine send send it by email and i'll get it to the right place that that folder is very daunting will do yeah we're a minute past i think our team it's pretty good so thank you for the walk through an explanation i've got three pages of notes to review with the team later today and then we'll our next steps are to work on the um requirement sheet so summer if you could please share the link with the dr cloud team um in email where the latest and greatest is we'll work on that today and then the other action i took is to put together a spreadsheet of the different interfaces and then the status of the outreach versus what we currently have in-house and i'll post that to sharepoint and share the link anything else from the county side okay no but i encourage everybody if something comes to mind just pop it in this chat that you didn't remember to tell us please um or just email me if you know you're like me at two o'clock in the morning i remember something doesn't matter just go right of all and just send it off right but thank you so much for for this i i really appreciate everybody's time on getting getting this meeting together i appreciate this a lot us too thank you thank you guys thank you thank you bye thank you all",
