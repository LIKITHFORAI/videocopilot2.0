  "text": "No, just for everyone's awareness, this meeting is being recorded. If you have any objections with that, I'll defer all of those objections to Dr as she when she joins this meeting. Silence. Silence. Phone ringing. Phone ringing. Phone ringing. Hello. Happy New Year. Joining the meeting? We'll give everyone just a little more minutes to join. Hi, everyone. Hello, everybody. Hello. Good afternoon. Okay, thank you. We can go ahead and get started. Everyone else is trickling as they're able to join. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon for this workflow meeting. Hello. Thank you for joining this workflow meeting. Unfortunately, Dr. Nembhard gave the introductions. Here she is. Give me one second. We'll let her do the honors. Hey, Dr. Nembhard, I was just talking about you. I'll just let the meeting know that you would be doing the introductions. So I can pass it over to you. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you again for everyone for joining. Wow. Look at how many times I saw Nina and Keisha today. That's amazing. I don't normally see them, but it is the first of the year, so we'll see how it goes. And Kim is coming in. So I just wanted to share that this meeting is, of course, trying to get to the exact data that you're putting in NextGen today. So we're hoping that someone can share their screen, kind of walk us through your intake, where you put information in NextGen currently, and where you put anything that's outside. Even if it's like, okay, I put this in documentation. One of the things that would be nice to know, and I didn't tell the other team, is if you're using any field in NextGen now that is different from what it's really supposed to be, no one is going to judge you. Right, Neil? Nobody's judging. So we just need to know, because we're going to take it for what it is. So if it's supposed to be something else, let us know, because we wouldn't know otherwise. Make sense? Joanne, who's going to be sharing with us today and walking us through their process? Axel is ready. Axel? Hi, Axel. You got this. Thank you. Thank you, Axel. You're welcome. But go ahead. Any information that you need to share with us, you can share with us later. Most of your documents, we're supposed to already have. We have it in the SharePoint, if you shared with us before. So you don't have to worry about any of that. But thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. So Anna Samuels is our community health nurse. She will be joining a little later. But Dr. Persaud is here for the EHR part. The nurse typically handles that, but I can show the workflow. Let me share my screen. No, I'm very jealous of Axel's calendar. I'm glad you showed it. You should see what mine looks like. Would you like to see mine? I had a 30-minute break today. 30 minutes. It was gone. So one of the things that we won't be doing, and Salwin said this moving forward, we won't be accessing Dr. Cloud this way. Okay. That's good news. I want to point that out. That's good news. And I need to say that at every meeting. We will not be accessing Dr. Cloud this way. So this is, I'm not sure how much in detail you want to see the process. Are you interested in me showing the entire workflow? Yes, as detailed as I possibly can. Exactly what you're putting into it. Okay, so in NextGen, our workflow starts making an appointment in PM. I'm going to use this test child here in NextGen. So typically someone calls our main line and makes an appointment, and the front desk person is responsible for scheduling. And again, I'm going to use this test. So we confirm basic demographic information over the phone, and whether or not the patient, in this case the child, is eligible to receive our services. And once we confirm eligibility, we schedule the appointment. Eligibility external, correct? Say that again? Eligibility is external. What do you mean external? How do you determine eligibility? So eligibility for our program is, for instance, for vaccine for children. It's a child 18 years old or younger, uninsured or underinsured, or Medicaid recipient. That's our basic eligibility. Montgomery County resident. Okay, do you put that in NextGen at all? That eligibility check, or is that just external? Funnily enough, that verification is done on a paper form, and then it goes into NextGen a little later in the workflow. Okay. Can I add to that to Axel and Dr. Lachon? Yes. So the first thing when Axel was saying registration, it's done over the phone, and the secretary will make sure the patient met eligibility. So that's a verbal conversation. The official document, it's a consent, a written consent, where we have those variables explained in the document that they complete prior to vaccination and screened, so it's part of the screening process. The third piece I wanted to add to this is, in NextGen, it's already in there populated with these criteria of no insurance, Medicaid recipient, and so forth. But that is also on our paper that's already actually in NextGen. So when on documentation, when we go to document, usually it's the nurses, we have to check those criteria. And, yes, the patient, it has to be zero to 18 years of age to be qualified for VFC vaccines. And this is only for children documentation we use the NextGen for at this time. So verbally, and then when they come in, they complete the paperwork, and it's also already populated in NextGen for all the immunization centers across our HHS. I hope that helped to make things more clear. Perfect. Thank you. So once the patient comes to our clinic, they turn in the completed form, and then we can start the check-in process. That's what I'm going to do now. And when I do this, I will be creating an encounter. NextGen, because this is an existing patient, is taking me to the creation of the encounter for today. But on previous screens, we confirm the demographic information and insurance status. This is the screen that I was talking about. So if the demographic information was not there, because this would be a known patient, we enter it manually. Not all these fields are required. If the patient is a Medicaid recipient, we enter that information here. And then for insurance, this is the screen. If the patient has an MCO, we can enter that information here. There's a different process. For new insurance, if the insurance information is not there, this is where we put it in. We can select the MCO for billing later. Once I do this, this is the last. Once I finish this part of the process, the patient is considered checked in. And so at this point, the patient will be ready to see the nurse. And the nurse at this point can see that the patient is checked in. Then EHR. So for immunizations, when the patient is ready to see the nurse, the immunizations needed are already determined. So the nurse can go and generate an order. There's one part of the process that I don't remember where she does the intake notes. But I can show how the nurse puts in the order for immunizations. So this is the order module for immunizations. We use this part and generate a new order. Next trend here shows, and this is fairly new, it shows what the patient is due for. But like I said, we already know what the patient needs because the patients have been pre-screened. So we're going to generate a new order. This is our immunization template where we select the vaccines for the new order. And I'm going to go to the VFC template. So I'm going to select one or two of the vaccines that are due for this child. Let's say hepatitis A. I'm going to select HPV. Once I select the immunizations that are due, I go to, or the nurse goes to vaccine details. These available lot numbers are entered into NextGen by our warehouse manager. And if he's not available, I do it as well. So this is basic vaccine information. Dose, dosage, strength. So that's all entered by the inventory, by the person who does the inventory. Did you have a question, Richon? Yeah, one quick question. So is there any business rule on this part of your process that the system helps to refine? I don't think. Yeah, I can answer. I saw your question. Well, the system ensures I do not make an appropriate. I was looking at your question. Is there any policy in the immunization selection? Policy. So we have each immunization center should have Dr. Davis immunization standard IZ protocol. When I say the standard IZ, it's already written here that we follow to make sure the vaccines that we have on the VFC formulary list are on that standard IZ protocol. We don't give anything that's not on that sign-off standard IZ guidelines protocol, we call it, standard orders. That's number one I wanted to say. We have that in place. We follow the ACIP guidelines, which is where the protocol is driven by and our practice is driven by. So does that answer your question of policy and immunization selection? Because we have to follow that based on age, appropriate age, and interval schedule. Great. Yeah, so that is what, yes, go ahead. No, so what I was more asking is, is there anything in the system that helps with alignment? Oh, that would prompt you. Got it. It's safety, like a safety, and we need that for everything we do. I'm happy to report that NextGen, which is something we have to work on, and I hope Dr. Cloud has something that's more accurate. So apparently, originally, NextGen has, there are some vaccines such as, let's take chicken pox, for instance, which is great. That is when you select the vaccine, that's always showing the template. And when you go to administer after you click on vaccine details, it would tell you that remind the parent not to give aspirin because aspirin has this effect with a live virus. Our children under this age should not be given aspirin because of the Reye syndrome adverse reaction. So that is great, and we love it because of safety thing. But also, there are some vaccines in NextGen, like for flu vaccine, I can recall that it gives us the wrong information. So we override it and give it anyway. I sometimes make a comment because it gives me a different age. Yes, I can give this child flu from six months of age, but I think if I can recall, I don't know if Axel will remember, it may have a different age. So I think what is actually in the system, occasionally I find for one or two vaccines, it's not accurate. But because we know the age that we can give flu, for example, from six months and older, we go ahead and administer it. But the system tells me not to give it. But I know I'm within the right. So to answer your question, the system NextGen currently has something that stops us and gives us an alert. So I'm happy to know we have alerts, but we have to work on making sure those alerts are aligned with the correct guidelines that's out there for immunization. So, yes, so it does have it, and I'm happy. I'm hoping Dr. Cloud has that tool to let us stop, look, before we give. OK, so, and this is a question for Cherise and Selwyn. Do we have those business rules separate and can be associated with this process? Because I know Axel won't be able to show all of that. Is that something that we can pinpoint and provide to Dr. Cloud? No, those rules are integrated into NextGen, and a lot of what NextGen has, they get from the CDC. So like the CVX numbers and all of that stuff, that's not entered in by IT. And it's not really entered in by NextGen either. They get that from the CDC, and they import all of that. And so that's how it's operated within NextGen. OK, perfect. So the understanding, again, for the Dr. Cloud people is that we'll take, then, Cherise, whatever. That's part of their certification, right? It's a certified EHR, so you would expect them to have that. And there's no other business rule that we created, right? No, we don't create any rules. No. OK. OK, and then I make a comment. That's good to hear, Cherise, because I just was wondering whether anybody can manually input that. So I'm happy to hear it's taken CDC, the current evidence, that it actually would populate there to give us the, OK, the guidance. OK. Because I just wonder why. I have to make a note with vaccine one or two that's giving me a little bit different information. We'll follow up on that on NextGen. But, yes. But I'm glad it's CDC, yes, because CDC is publishing the ACIP, which is all integrated. Yeah. So, great. Good to know. Thanks. Yes, I think that's one thing that we need to make sure. IT does not enter any rules in the system. I think that would be a major violation of their certification anyway. So we don't enter anything that is not. We may or we used to, when it was on premise, we would update the formularies and so on. And there was a process for that. We didn't do anything except follow their process for updating those files or whatever. But, no. OK. Thank you. Thank you. All right. This is Anne. No, I'm sorry for joining late, but I just had a quick question. So if it's not updated, who do we contact to submit a request for it to be updated? Like for instance, the Mengeococcal B, that schedule was updated and I just, it's still in NextGen is saying like, the series is one dose and then you wait six months, but it's now, well, that's the new recommendation, but in NextGen it's still saying like, give the dose within one month. So who do we contact for that to be updated in NextGen? Please open, Anna, this is Charisse, please open up a ticket. Okay. And indicate what you just said, and then IT can follow up from there. So just open up a help IT service model ticket and then IT can work with NextGen to determine an update. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Just one quick note, this is Ramesh from InSoftech. So what I'm, I guess what we're seeing here is the process of getting a child in and then administering a vaccine, is that right? Yes. Okay. And these alerts that are popping up, is that based on data that's in the system that NextGen has that's providing these indications, if you will, because the process in Dr. Cloud EHR is a little bit different in terms of how the vaccine is administered and then subsequent to that, how we share that information with the immunization registry. So the alerts, go ahead, Charisse. No, right, because the alert is under the nurses documentation piece, and Anna, you can speak to it or Axel, you have anything else, but when you get to this template where Axel is on vaccine details, and as soon as you hit that, and then you go and say VIS is given, print and give VIS, then the alert pops up automatically. Like I would have an alert for chickenpox, make sure you inform the patient not to give the child if child is one year old not to give aspirin. And so we acknowledge it and we just make sure, because we give chickenpox to a child who's 12 years anyway, not anything less, but it's just alert. So it just pops up in the system prior to administering the vaccine. So I don't know, the system from CDC, I don't know how that get there, which is a great feature, I do agree, but I don't know, it just populates for us. Does that answer what you were asking? Just to sort of reinforce what you said, there are other alerts, for instance, when if we are trying to administer a vaccine that is not due, if it's too early, or if it's not age appropriate, we see an alert like the one I showed for varicilla and this test patient, I believe everybody has two doses of varicilla, and doesn't need a third. So when I selected it, NextGen gave me that alert that the vaccine is not due. It will also alert you if the vaccine is expired. Yes. That's another alert. True. In this same screen, we document eligibility for a vaccine and we do it here. We see a lot of children who are VFC eligible and are uninsured. I believe that's the correct way to go. I'm gonna quickly complete this for the other vaccine. Let's see, this is a good example. I selected a lot number for a vaccine that's expired. This is where we document that the VIS, the Vaccine Information Statement is given. We do it, we give a paper copy to the parent. So this is where after everything is completed for the vaccine details, we click on Save. And I believe it's at this point that the information for the vaccine is transferred over to the Maryland Vaccine Registry. Right, Anna, is that right? Yeah, it goes directly into Immunet after you click Save, yes. So at this point, the visit with the nurse is over and then the patient or the parent would go back to the front desk to start the checkout process. And that's what I can show now. Axel, one other thing that I do is I also document a nurse's note. Oh yeah, I didn't know where that goes. You go to like new, like file new, I think, like a new, like if you were gonna do a new order. And then I go to, or wait, no, sorry, hold on. Where do I go? I go to templates, I think, templates, and then should say like nurse's note. Yeah, and then I click all, and then it should say like nurse note or something like that, yeah. Yeah, it will say nurse's note. Or I think it says intake, maybe. Maybe it's intake, and then I go to nurse's note, yeah. Intake, and then I click at the top specialty page pediatrics, and then immunization, or nurse's note, or something like that. And then I hand type something in regards to the visit. Is this nurse's visit? Yes, nurse's visit. And then I check the historian, so whoever they came with, whether it was their mom, their dad. And then under immunizations on that left side, that's where I double click, and I type in a free note in regards to the visit that I discussed the vaccines, BIS given. I also write in if the patient or if the parent denied getting a vaccine, I write in there. And then I also write when they should return, education they were given. And then if for some reason, the patient had an allergic reaction or something, that's where I would also write that in. And then there's also a box after I click save, there's a box to check off allergies as well again. And then I can save the note as well. That's one last step I do in my documentation. I remember the allergies, but it is somewhere there. Yeah, so that's, I think if you scroll, oh yeah, I wrote that there's like no, yeah. That page, oh, I clicked no relevant past medical surgical history. I checked that box and then I checked the allergy box. And if they do have an allergy, I'll enter it. And then I save it for each client, each visit. And may I add, those are the three things we were told years ago to enter the next trend that's more pertaining essential to immunization, the custodian, the reason for the visit and any allergies. But prior to that, we look at the demographics of the patient because a lot of them, there are a lot of practitioners that are using this system. So we can open it to see if there's any history of anything. So you get to look at that. But as I said before, the system is a little bit busy and it can become a little complicated and time consuming. I hope Dr. Claude will make it simpler for us. Everything on one page, immunization has its own place and everything is there just to click and complete as relevant to the vaccines and the education piece and all of that. And I want to add this point. So under the nurse's note, if anything that's essential or anything that's besides the reason for the visit, if we have to go back and add anything, you can go back to the nurse's note and add that. So the nurse's note is there for free text and typing. Anything a patient doesn't understand English or they speak a strange language, we'll make a documentation of that and what type of method we use to communicate. If the patient gets dizzy after the vaccine, we write that and how they do and the discharge in stable condition. So anything that's essential regarding to the practice with the patient, it's entered on the nurse's note. Or there's a comment too on the template. Sometimes we add things there. Okay, and then to finalize the encounter, like I was gonna show, we start the checkout process. We typically don't use this part of the workflow, but it's to make an appointment, a return appointment. This is where we confirm the insurance for this particular encounter. And here the system is asking me, or in this case, the front desk person, to confirm the charges for this particular encounter. The front desk person to confirm the charges for the two vaccines that were administered. Because the insurance is selected for this particular encounter was, I believe, non-billable. The system is already waiving the administration fee of $23.28. For both vaccines. So in this case, the parent would not pay any part of the administration fee. And I can carry on and go to the next page. If I had selected insurance for this encounter in that previous screen, there would have been one more step, and it's the next-gen sending information for billing. And that is the last step of the workflow. Okay. Okay. That's it. All right. This is Ryan. Are there any reporting requirements that you have set up for this program or anything that goes out to the state? We sometimes have to report numbers to internally and for other purposes, also for the state. And we use the report section. There are some saved reports that we have used over the years that we run on a regular basis, and they are stored here. The report section is pretty comprehensive. I typically run saved reports on a regular basis for Dr. Persaud and for Kimberly, Sean. Let me piggyback to that, too, with Atul and Axel regarding reports. So occasionally, well, the billing has its part that the OFC deals with that because weekly we have to send in stuff to them, and Ryan deals with that. So, yeah, there is a fiscal part to it. But regarding for the state of Maryland, we are able to use next-gen because we do that every three years, a review of the VFC program, and they actually would want us to go into next-gen to bring up some patients. The last time we had a review was 24, last year, or 223, one of that, either 224 or 223, most recent. And I think they gave us 12 patients that we actually have to go into the system to show them. So we have to show them what we have done, how we selected the patients, checking off Medicaid or no insurance. So all those details that Axel just went over, the state usually wants to have that. That's one thing. But they visually look at that in person. One time they did it virtually, and we had to pull up the patients virtually. But the other piece, they had to get a report on Medicaid recipients and look at billable, non-billable paperwork we had to do for them, like a redacted paperwork. And that was about it, that review for the VFC program. They usually look at the next-gen documentation, how we enter our patients, how we document, and then they want to see the billing portion. So that's about it with the state. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Dr. Cloudteam, any other questions on the workflow you saw? Chris, Neil, Ramesh? Nothing for me. I'd like to see what integrations you have with Immunet. So what information is sent from the EHR to Immunet? What information is received from Immunet into the EHR? Let's see here. Axel, you want to pull up that part? We also have an Immunet query that helps us. That's a feature next-gen has. Next-gen has where we can actually, okay, two things I wanted to say. And Axel, you can correct me or Anna. There's one feature that next-gen currently has. You can query Immunet record to compare with next-gen, what populates in next-gen, but under or over-vaccinating. Also, if we have a patient who we have never vaccinated and come in with a record, a physical record, where we have to input their vaccine's history into next-gen, but we want it into Immunet. So I believe it has a feature where we can put the vaccine details, like the name of the vaccine, that I put it in next-gen. It's historical, so I'm manually entering it so that it can get to Immunet. But there is a way that the feature, and Axel, you can explain that, because we have done it twice or three times. We have done it. We go to next-gen. So you enter the name of the vaccine, gets in there. That's one. The lot number, the expiration date, and the manufacturer. Those are the vaccine details that gets into Immunet. From next-gen into Immunet. Am I missing anything? Oh, and also the site, I believe. The site where the vaccine was given. That's about it. Yeah, before there was exchange of information between next-gen and Immunet, we would do this manually. I'm trying to query. And when I... Okay, there's no match. Okay. So here, if this was a real patient, and the patient is also in Immunet, next-gen is able to download the information from... vaccine information from Immunet directly. Rishan, do you have a question? How often do you search for the patient on Immunet like this? So this is where you're downloading their history? Yes. So this is, we used to do it before every clinic, so once or twice a week, just to have a complete medical record for the child in next-gen. But we currently get that information directly from Immunet before our clinic day. So what Axel is saying, let me just reiterate, because for safety of vaccine administration, they're not very particular. We vet the records well. So we look at next-gen, which they have a feature, which is great, and I don't feel it's redundancy because, oh, why? Immunet is giving me the same thing. Why am I doing next-gen? Next-gen is giving me the same thing. But once in a while, with my experience with it, and I'm sure Anna has some experience, and Axel, I'm sorry, because we have encountered once in a while where something doesn't match. Hence the reason they look at next-gen prior to the clinic day, our VFC vaccine for children, and Tuesdays and Thursdays at our clinic. So we do it Monday and we do it on Wednesday. We look at VFC record, we look at next-gen, and we look at Immunet because we want to make sure that both are in sync because next-gen also, and Axel was showing earlier, it populates to say when the vaccine is due. And we should have 100% with Immunet. But once in a while, you can have, you can't trust everything, so we just like to double-check, and that's the reason. Maybe we're doing extra work, but we like to do that because we want to make sure that we have the option of using next-gen and Immunet or both, just to make sure when the child comes in, we already know what they have been given. This is for a child with already established patients. Somebody new takes longer because we have to input. We have to input somebody with a record, and you've got to translate, and you have to make sure we are on the right schedule, the interval, the spacing. So yes, so that is why we're doing what we do twice. We do next-gen and we do Immunet, just for you to know that's our way of doing things, yeah. But so that's that for that. I don't know if I answered your question. Sorry, I don't actually want to add anything else or add. I believe that the question also was what information specifically transfers over to Immunet. I was trying to log into Immunet, but I have to update my password. The information that transfers over is this information from the vaccine details, which is vaccine, lot number, the expiration and the site. Yeah, I mentioned that earlier in the name of the vaccine. While we're in that, can I quickly ask a different question? I wanted to ask, I don't want to forget it because we do, besides the VFC program and to the team experts here, we do back-to-school and we do flu clinics, and I would have liked those to be categorized separately because of data purposes. VFC is on its own, and we'll talk about the back-to-school vaccines. That's another thing from the state that we give at certain times of the year. It's not every day, it's twice a year. I would have liked to see that we have an immunization section of Dr. Cloud. We have our VFC, and then there is a link that take us to back-to-school because we only have seven vaccines for back-to-school to give the kids for free twice a year. Then also we have the flu season. For data purposes, I would have liked to see it organized that way, so that we're able to document accurately in a more structured and organized fashion. You have flu separate, you have the back-to-school, and we have the VFC, and lo and behold, we now have adult vaccines, so that's another one, adult category. So I don't know how much the features that Dr. Cloud can present, but I just want you to keep that in mind with our immunization. Our process is a lot, it's short and simple. Short and simple, we like that. That's kind of what we've been focusing on, but Chris from our team is ready to kind of show you what we have. But before we move to that, it looks like Rishon has a question. She has her hand up. Yeah, so I was talking about the interface between Immunet and NextGen. For in the Dr. Anissa, Dr. Cloud question, can it just be one search? Like, can information just be searched in one place? Because I'm not really sure why we need to do this when we can just do one search. So, like I said, what we do is different, and we can show you what we have, and then let's, if we can save the questions for after that process, we'll be able to answer that. I'm sorry, is it Rishon or Richon? It's Richon. Richon, sorry, okay, thank you, appreciate that. So Richon, it's, you know, Chris is ready to show what we have. You know, we try to abstract the registry portion of it. The demo that we're going to be showing right now is not directly to Immunet. We will need to, so there is some setup that needs to happen where we will need information about the county's credentials to connect to Immunet, so. Okay, so Ramesh, that leads me to my other question that I had before when my hand up was up. Now, Selwyn promised that we don't do any business roles in NextGen. For operational and efficiency, we probably have to, but I don't want to sacrifice the integrity of an EHR to do so, and again, is that something, you don't have to answer it now, is that something that Dr. Cloud's going to accommodate? Can you repeat the question again? I want to make sure that I've understood. So there are business roles based on CDC guidelines and other guidelines, probably federalized, and those are easy, right? Those are easy to have in the system. There are operational roles about how we operate. Is there a space for that inside? Can you give me an example of an operational rule? Are you referring to a rule, Richon, or a workflow, kind of a process flow? A process flow, that's what it is. Well, NextGen allows you to do process flows, but that's governed mostly by which templates you enter and the flow of information. So I think all EHRs have that ability. You are allowed to say, well, okay, I'm going to do this activity before that activity. Nah, that's not what I'm asking themselves. That's not what you're asking? No, no. Okay. I'm saying, and this is a very bad example, but I'm going to do it, right? We only serve individuals that are 18 and older in a particular program. I'm trying to give a vaccine to a 12-year-old, right? And I get that far in the system to select the vaccine, right? Say there's nothing on the CDC side to stop me. Like, is that something we can put in the system and say, okay, you know what the rule is? And it's a bad example, but I'm saying, can we interject a business rule? So you're free texting like a warning, like if it can input a warning. I know I know. The warning will actually stop you from doing it. Yeah. So right now it doesn't do it. Right now it doesn't do it. So let's let Chris show. Let's let Chris show. It doesn't do the warnings or alerts right now, but let's let Chris show how we, you know, administer a vaccine and, you know, information that... Before we do that, Axel, Dr. Prasad, you think that's everything? We're good? I think so. For me, I just want an organization, like an immunization in the Dr. Cloud. We have our own area where we can just click on one thing and I go to this. For example, Ryan, what's the name? I'm sorry, I'm forgetting everybody's name. If I can, or Chris, I can go to VFC and everything is there for me, just like what we saw on NextGen, but in a simpler manner. And I go to adult vaccine page and everything is there. All my vaccines are listed and CDC gets inputted in there because they have the right interval, the right age group, and then maybe we can have an alert. But sometimes we may not have all the alerts. And I heard what Dr. Vachon was saying that maybe we can free text something. Right now you said no. But I think we got it all. I think we got it all. And if Anna has anything else to add, right now what we're dealing with NextGen, we will talk about that and the ticket. But right now I think that's about it for us. We need the workflow, right, Axel? Thank you for doing a great job, Axel. Appreciate that. That's what everybody does for showing how that works. And I think that is from the beginning to the end of taking a patient and out discharging them. Yeah, the billing. Yep, if any questions, just reach out to us in case we miss anything or you all have any questions or we forgot something, please, we can always reach out to you all and just to have the right contact, yeah. That's it for me. I don't have anything else to add. Chris, take it away. Okay, so I'll go ahead and share my screen then. And just for those of you who have not seen the Dr. Cloud system before, I'm just gonna quickly go over the way the system is laid out. So I have the client that I currently am working with up here at the top. This is what we refer to as the client info banner. So the client that I have selected is gonna be displayed up here. Then I have the main menu bar, which allows me to navigate to the different areas of the system. And when I click on one of those areas that I have access to, I have the sidebar menu that loads with the menu options that are available to me. And right now I'm on the main client summary page, which if I scroll down, there's clinical information on the right-hand side here. So if I scroll down, I can see information like upcoming reminders and notifications related to screenings or tests that need to be performed for this particular client based on their demographic profile. Then down at the bottom, I have the immunization section. And when I click on edit, this is where I would go to see the list of immunizations that have been administered for this particular client. I can also tag those two encounters where I can document additional information for this person. And I can see their encounter history here that shows me a list of the encounters that we have provided for this person and all the programs that I have access to. So to add an immunization, I would click on add, and then I would look up the CVX code. And if they refuse the immunization, I can indicate that here and track that. But I would put in the code and then select the vaccine that comes up when I put in that code. And then I would choose based on the inventory, the trade name, the lot number, and then the NDC code is automatically populated based on that selection of the CVX code. Then it fills in the manufacturer name based on what was from the inventory. The expiration date is filled in from the inventory. The date administered is automatically filled in with today's date, but I can change the date on the calendar. I would put in the dose, how many amounts were administered, and then the amount. So it'd be, and then I would say the number, or let's say this would be 100 milligrams. And then the route would be how we injected that, where we injected it, and then the completion status, and then the information source that we used, and then the action code, what we're doing with this particular immunization. And then we can enter any notes. And then we have observation and observation criteria, and we can add additional observation criteria as we need to based on additional observations. So that's the process for adding an immunization in Dr. Cloud. So they have a piece, Chris, do they have a piece on education, or we give the vaccine, I see you give the vaccine information, but you have like a blank area notes. I see notes where we can put it, got it, okay. So it has that option. One other question I had on this page. So does it have a place where we have to, like what we do currently for next gen, we enter all the vaccines received because we put in the CVX code and all of that expiration date so that it can populate when we go to document, right? Is there a place? Yes, yeah, that would be the, yeah, that's the... Another page. Yeah, it's in our inventory management. So I would go into the inventory. And then I can see the immunizations. Here's my inventory and it shows me my existing accounts for the lot that we entered, the number administered, how many we have remaining in inventory. So this is where that information is coming from to populate the immunization information, including the lot number and the manufacturer name and things like that. Okay, I see. So yeah, we sent to that part. Okay. Anything that's missing? Anna, I just have a quick question. Can I, if, can you go back to the page where you were at on the, how to document? So you would have to enter the CVX code to select a vaccine. There's not like a, like on NextGen, you can just click BATDAP and like select, but here you select a, you have to type in the code. Yeah, no, you can put in the name of the, so when you start typing, it gives you a list of results, just select it, yeah. And then for like the VFC eligibility, you would choose down there, like it says vaccine funding program. And then is there a place where you can type what kind of insurance they have? Oh, there. Okay, I just want to make sure. Yeah, funding source and then the public. Public, yes. And then if they're Medicaid or whatever. Okay, because that's just what the state requires us to, when they audit us, I just wanted to make sure that was there. Okay, thank you. But I don't see Medicaid there, Anna. Can you look back, can I see that again? The Medicaid, I'm sorry, I don't see Medicaid, where is that? There's, it might be public or. Public, but I think they're current as a Medicaid. Yeah, if you click public VFC and then what's the one above it? I think the R criteria value. Oh, I see Medicaid, yeah, Medicaid. Okay, so it's under that. Okay, see it. Yeah, and that's the data that then gets submitted to the registry. Okay. I see. Okay, so it has all the vaccine details. It has the criteria for VFC and even if it's not VFC, does it have someone who's a state funded? Let's see if you have state funded in there. Funded source, where is that? Observational, public, where is the observational? Yeah, because on NextGen, there's one that says state program eligibility and then there's also an option for 317 funding. So that's helpful when we have our back to school or in the future, our adult programs. That's what the state requires us when we're documenting in Immunet that it shows that it was either from the state program eligibility or 317 funds. Yeah, and that's easy for us to add to these options. We're just based on what the state needs to see there. Yeah, so we'll send that to you because state is state funds. Then the 317 is federal funds. So for billing and coding purposes for the state, they want that. And we have that in Immunet too when we have to do Immunet. But also, we do some documentation for back to school in Next, which we will use Dr. Cloud for. And if we can use Dr. Cloud for everything and then it interfaces with Immunet, that would be wonderful. But we can see what we can do and what options we have. But those are two EHRs because a state, what they want and require and what we have to have for the county and when we need data and pull for the state audit, yeah. So those two, I don't see. I don't see state eligibility in 317. So we'll send that to you to add to that. Yeah, and then we have public. We have VFC, public VFC, non-VFC. That's where we'll add that under the observational, yes. Okay, any other questions or anything else you want me to show right now? Jim Karchi. Chris, I had a quick, this is an administrative question. So where would you see probably a dashboard of your work for the day or who you're serving in a program, ones that are due, any kind of alerts? Like where would you see that? Or is that something you have to do in reports only? No, that would be in my dashboard. So in my dashboard, I can see the clients that are currently assigned to me along with the notifications of things that are deficient. So if I see like these icons here, letting me know that I'm deficient and filling that out, that specific form. So these would be the forms or tasks that I need to make sure I'm performing for my clients. And these would be specific to me. So I would show the ones that are specific to what I'm doing. And then this would be the notification and how it would show up with the red frowny face, letting me know that that's deficient. And then the date is due there. Sorry, you're getting this from the client is assigned. How are you getting this assigned to the worker? Yes. Yep, it's assigned. And then it's based on the rules that are set up around what needs to be done for this person at what milestone in the episode of care. Actually, Dr. Rishan, do we assign clients now? Dr. Rishan, you're asking me about assigned clients? Yes, we assigned in the appointment registration. Yeah, we do. So I have a quick question to follow up with Dr. Rishan was talking about. I know that I'm listening and I'm trying to figure out what else. Chris, is there a printout summary, like the patient come in and see like they go home and what we have done for the day? I mean, we do. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so we have an after visit summary you can print out based on what was filled in for the visit. So when I go into the encounter, I can choose to print off an after visit summary. Got it. And then I can print that off for them. And you can print it out what we have done for the day just to compare. We do give them an immunization record, but I think moving forward, that would be nice. A number two question was, so when we do make an appointment in this, in Dr. Cloud, and with the patient, can they have a reminder, like with a telephone or? Yeah, that's done via our third party reminder service. And so we interface with them. We send them a file with all the upcoming appointments, and then they send out the notifications. And then we can receive back the cancellation notices if they respond and say they'd like to cancel. Oh, got it. Oh. So we, by default, out of the box, we have the ability to send emails when they're scheduling the appointment to remind them. So if they cancel, how would we know it would default back in the system? Yeah, it'll update the appointment status. It will update the slot. Good to know. Good to know. And what's the best thing we should get from the patient? Both work, email or text phone number? Phone number, right? Yeah, I would say both if you can, but yeah. I see. So, sorry, I didn't have my end up, but I know Joanne did. I'll go after her. Hi, yeah. So I may be getting ahead of myself, but what does the patient see in their patient portal based on what immunizations they received? Will they be able to see that in their portal? Can they print copies out? Are you able to show me kind of their view or our view of their patient portal? Yeah, let's take a look at that here. And does that get created automatically or does the patient need to sign up and register? No, yeah, it gets created automatically. It doesn't require any work on your part, but in the report section, they can see their lab results and then they can see diagnoses. They can see medications they're currently taking and request refills. And then down here at the bottom, oh, it shows their allergies. I thought we showed immunizations in here, but maybe that's something we have to enable. So yeah that would be something we'd have to turn on. It looks like it's not showing up right now. Okay and I see the inbox there. So is this where the patient would be able to reschedule their appointment or reach out to the provider? Yeah absolutely. Yeah they could send a message their provider. They can also see their scheduled upcoming appointments and they can schedule appointments from here if they want to. But that's something we would talk about you know and in a session where we go over the options for that. Got it. Thank you. Yeah we'll go over the options. We will have to give all of the options because we may have patients who are not computer-savvy, don't speak the language, Spanish or other languages where they're Spanish, they're racist, but sometimes they can't read. So yeah so all the options should be there. It's something they can do. Most of the time we let the patients call us because it's easier for them to dial our number and we help them. We help them to reschedule things like that. But all the options since we brought it up should be there. The one thing I wanted to ask at the beginning of the template on your first page, the summary page, do you have something there with an encounter with our template encounter? This HIPAA confidentiality is there that we check off that we've provided that? I don't remember seeing that. That's something we could definitely include. Yeah because we do have a form we give to patients, a physical form. So I want a place to check it out that that was provided. Just like when we do the documentation for vaccines, the vaccine information was given, statement was given. So we need that for the HIPAA. Yeah and also another part I think as we're talking and I went to the HIPAA class again, we have two patients come in for an immunization record. We're doing the confidentiality form that we have to check off too. And I'd like that to be that we did, I don't know how we can do that, but we'll figure that out. That we have given, we have provided that for them to complete before we give them their record. Yeah so we'll figure that out how we can add that in there too for those who want their record. When they come, like they come ten days later or a month later. Yeah we can pull up their name and just check off. Yeah because we have to make sure we give it to the right person. Yeah okay so those are two little things I'm remembering as we're going through. Okay. So Chris I have a couple of just operational questions and I figure we're gonna have a different discussion on more of the general across HHS because this is just one program, right? Yes. So there, I just want to make sure somewhere let's leave some room for that because there's some larger interoperability space that we want to talk about and we want to streamline it for all of HHS, right? So as these things bubble up, let's make sure that it's, you know, it's not just for this program but for everyone else. The other thing that I wanted to ask is in terms of the client portal, just as a note, how is that triggered to the customer? Is it on the scheduling? Like how is that triggered? Well it has to be created so you'd have to create the credentials to give them to log into the portal. Okay so or we have a unique web server to our customers where we have to provide them information of how to do stuff so we need to create some space for that, Chris. I don't know how and some room to actually do do this, right? Because we'll have a lot of customers just completely not understand what we're doing and the change I don't want to stay in front of that. So if we also could talk about that before we launch this on customers like okay is there information I can share with them and how to do this thing, how to set these things up, what they're going to see, they're not used to it now. I need some space to talk that through if that's okay. Absolutely, absolutely, Rich. And so what you're asking about is sending packets of information to patients and then they log into the portal and fill out that information or there might be forms that they need to, you know, or message the provider and things like that. Yeah, of course. I mean we're gonna train, you know, everybody, you and the staff so that you can show customers what that's gonna look like. Okay and when you've launched this is on a place if you can share with us your marketing thing because we also also put it in the lobbies like this has to be this big thing. The other thing that we can't really accommodate as much as we would like to is helping every customer on that first intake, right? Because we're still doing intake. So I'm trying to stay ahead of some of these things that the customer can do it. And I'm assuming this is an app, right? So it's an app that you download and all that. In this case, no, it won't be an app necessarily. It'll be through the browser. Okay. And then they'll get emails and things like that that they can log in and manage. But okay, browser that is iOS friendly, agnostic? Yes, yes, yes, yeah. All right, okay. Yeah, let's talk that through. That's gonna be some preparation. Thank you. Chris, we should add that to the customer portal or Neil and Ryan. Let's add that to the intake and customer portal conversation. Yep, we'll do. I have a few questions. Chris, is there a place where I can write a generic nurse's note? I know I saw the notes for each vaccine, but next gen I just write like one note on the visit. Is there a place where I could document that? Yeah, that would be in the encounter itself. Okay. So there's, you can either put it in the main notes for the encounter or you would have a form attached that has the specific information you need filled out. Okay. And then for Dr. Cloud, typically we, if a patient brings in their record to be transcribed, we scan it and into next gen and then we enter it into Immunet. But I also know that some other of our sister clinics enter it directly into the EHR. Is there a place where you can enter historical immunization record in Dr. Cloud? Yeah, you would just upload it in their scan documents file and it would go in a folder labeled immunizations. But it wouldn't actually like show, cause in next gen you can enter it. You not only like upload the document, but you can also enter it. And then next gen tells you when the next dose is due. And so is that something that Dr. Cloud does? Or you just can scan the document in? I'm not sure. I mean, you can scan the document in, but we'd have to talk more about the rules around, you know, next dose or things like that. No, Dr. Cloud doesn't do any OCR features. There's a question in chat about OCR. Oh, okay. And then my last question is that we're doing a pilot program, like for quality improvement on reminder recall. Is there a way to be able to run a report and see which patients have missed, are late for a vaccine? And can we send out like a mass email email reminder telling them that they need to return to call for an appointment? Is that something that Dr. Cloud has? Yeah, that's the same third party automated appointment reminder service that we would set up. Okay. Ryan, is this, can you just confirm that that is actually part of the contract? Yeah, I'll take a look and make sure they have a telebox. Yeah, and Ramesh and Chris, right, so it can go with your third party. I wonder how far they can go back in recalling patients to return for missed or subsequent doses, because sometimes we have to go back to a year. We're trying to lessen it to do it six months. We're trying to work on it because we have patients who are way beyond and something we picked up this year, but I don't know how far they can go back to. That's a question I have. Oh, no, but they've been using. Here's a question, Dr. Cloud. So NextGen is going to be inputting into the stuff that's currently in NextGen, all programs are using, and that's a Dr. Richon question too. Am I getting, am I understanding that what's in NextGen currently, is he revising, edit to fit each program? Is that getting inputted going into phasing into Dr. Cloud? They are working together and then Dr. Cloud will be the official EHR. I don't mean to sound, I'm not an expert in this. No, right, so we're getting all this information so that, you know, come January, June, July 1st, you'll be able to do the same work you're doing in NextGen in Dr. Cloud. So what happens in NextGen, we're kind of revising, editing to make sure that gets inputted into the Dr. Cloud? Yes, wherever you put your data and the data will be transferred right there. So you should see your customer, your current customers, everything should be able to transfer. We just wanted to know exactly where you're putting all your data. Got it. So everything should be transferred. Okay, got it. Sorry, I need some clarity, but thank you for that. Yeah, and so that is why. Okay, so yeah, so hopefully Dr. Cloud, your third party can go back to like a year or so to retrieve patients who have missed their second or third doses. Okay, let's see what happens. You keep us posted. Okay. I think that's it from our side. Thank you so much. Any questions from the Dr. Cloud folks? You know, we're at time. We're a little bit over. Axel and team, thank you so much for a great job of walking us through this. I really appreciate it, Dr. Prasad and Joanne. I really appreciate those things. Yeah, thank you, Axel, Joanne, and Dr. Prasad and Richard. You know, we will need that information on how to connect with Immunet. So that's something that I would assume the sooner. So the sooner we can get, you know, interfaces typically are the ones that take up most amount of time. It's more logistics and, you know, to get the right people to make those connections and all of that stuff. And, you know, they won't respond to us because we're just a third party asking them information. So if you can initiate that conversation and bring us into the mix, then there is trust that is built and then they're willing to talk to us and, you know, help us through that process. So the sooner we can get that going, the better it's going to be. Sure. Yeah, I think Selwyn and Charisse is working on that for us. Yes, we are. Hey, I knew it. Thank you, guys. I appreciate all this. See you guys tomorrow. And thank you all for your time. We appreciate it. You're getting us on board to make sure we verbalize what we need. Thank you so much. Thanks, everybody. Thank you.",
