  "text": "information in your actual current workflow. Okay, so I will not, because I'm not familiar at this point in the game. So one of my team members, I don't know if Minor knows, I reached out to Reggie who's on this meeting invite, should also. Minor is ready, Dr. Neverson, he's ready. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. We stay ready. Minor, we're going to be using test clients for any one of your displays, because we're going to, we're asking you to share your screen, right? So if you can use a test client when you bring up NextGen, that'd be great, okay? All right. Thank you. One second. So, before Minor gets started, so for DrugCourt, this is a collaboration between HHS and DGS. How do you get the referral for your customer? A referral from, I'm sorry? How do you get your customers? Referrals either to the court, through the court side, walking, access, it depends. But majority of our referrals for DrugCourt, they come through the jail, from the court side. Okay, from the court side. But you do get other types of customers that are not associated with DrugCourt? DUI court, it also comes through the court side. Or DUI court. How do you figure out if there's other customers that are not associated with these two things that you actually see? All of the clients come through from the court, where the court's mental health provider for DrugCourt. Okay, so there's no other customers, nobody can walk in not associated with DrugCourt or the DUI court, and you see them, right, Anisha? Yes. Yes. It's usually referrals. Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Is Reggie not here? I don't see him. I reached out to him. I'm going to reach out to him. Okay. I'm getting him on a call now. We can start when you're ready. Yeah. Yes. My computer is still, for some reason, not loading. You said you want to do it out of the test mail, right? Right? Yes. Unfortunately, I don't have the test environment on my computer right now. No, in the normal schedule type the name test, because I think the department already got it. And it's not in the test environment, but it's in production, but it still says test, test patient. Gotcha. Yeah. Let me see something really quick, so I can put him over here. All right. So I'm here. I'm going to go ahead and just basically go ahead and try to do something with it. And if anything in particular that you want to see, how would you any first step you want to see? I think it would be good for them to see the process when you receive a referral, like what how you process that so that they are able to see the steps and see if they already have that in their system or if we need to create something or, you know, do some modifications. So show them the step by steps. Let's assume you receive a case today. Right. How would you enter that test? So, for example, usually our referrals come into the court, they have to be assessed by our supervisor therapist, which in this case is Reggie. He'll have to go in, make sure that he does the correct assessment. From there, either they enter, we enter the client, the person, the client has to come over here basically and see our admin person, which is Brian for the assessment. All of that is part of the referral, basically, and making sure that the client gets seen here at at Goody Drive. Whether, you know, it's it's usually by appointment only when they come here. I know Reggie sometimes does the assessment via Teams also, but I'll let him, you know, fill in a little bit more when it comes to that. Usually, Reggie is the one that does all the paperwork, basically the workhorse for the referrals. So in that sense, I don't know if he's already here. I don't know if he wants to. Can someone walk us through how they enter it when the client is first accepted into the program? How you enter it into NextGen? Once they're accepted, you mean once I've admitted them to the program? Yes. What is the next step to enter them into the program? The NextGen program? You know, guys, the purpose of this is for us to show them our workflow so they can make sure that they have it adequately. So when a person comes in, they're set up for services. They may have a few questions for you too, Reggie, about the clients that we take and how we get our referrals. I spoke to that, but you can also speak to that. But who is the person that's setting the person up in NextGen? Do we need to get one of Joyce's team members, or can you guys show us how we go through it in NextGen? We do it. The therapists do it. And that's service location. The client is either entered into the MAT or the drug court program. So who's going to walk us through that process? So this portion here about the demographic, this is admin. That's what Joyce does when she sees them. Correct. So, Reggie, when we first get a referral, where do we get the referral from and how? What's the very next thing that we do when it comes to processing them? So when we get the referral, do we enter the demographic stuff in first? Who does it? Or do we meet with them first? How do we get from a referral to actually having them as a client in NextGen? So the admission or having them as a client starts with the admin, which is Joyce. She enters demographic information, which shows on the page that just went down. OK. So when we get a referral, Joyce takes their information and creates a file for them. So she creates a profile for them in NextGen. That's correct. OK. And then after she creates, go ahead. And I also ask, how are those referrals received? Are they coming in via email or fax? They come in via email, but it's no electronic record at that point. It's just I get a name and contact information because they both come from the community as well as in jail. So I get I get information about a person that needs to be seen. Thank you. So usually I want to pitch in with Mr. Reggie saying. When they come see Miss Joyce in the client, the patient had never been seen in any of the county service areas. And it's it's brand new to to to our system. So the demographic area that Mr. Reggie speaking is this. This is done by by Miss Joyce Bryant or myself. Myself, if she's not available, we'll go ahead and fill out the demographic part. This is usually that includes the demographics, the status, plan, level of education, homeless, home address. All this part gets filled out by either Miss Joyce or myself before they even come here to see. Once this is created, we create a profile basically for that client and then we'll go into the system. And basically we try to fill out most of the information, all of it. We try to gather all that information in this demographic information template. And that's from there. That's when they would be seen by a therapist. Followed by that. So if you can see this, I would see my screen. These are the demographic table that Mr. Reggie was talking about. Yes. Great. Thank you. Is there anything special about your program that you fill in on the demographics that you want to take note of? Our from our part is very complete, very complete overall. So we try to get as much information as we can. Usually when we when we see the client here. But I think what they need to know, Maynard, is if you have noticed any discrepancies or needs in the system that we currently use of areas that needs to be completed with the information that you are receiving, but that you you currently don't have it or you would like to have it because it's not there. For example, I have another program who is using a completely different system and they have an external ID to identify their patients. So Dr. Cloud has an area for an external ID that we can use in the demographic section. You know what I mean? Like so something that you have noticed that you don't have, but you need to have. Gotcha. So that would be great, actually. So a lot of times, let's say, you know, we've seen the client or we want to give a different, you know, all clients have an MRN number. Right. But based on that, also, we also have, as Arneesha mentioned earlier, we do have clients from mental health, drug court, DUI court. Right. So let's say if I was to see this client a lot of times, let's say when when we register these clients, a lot of times what we encounter is that on this demographic table, we see that people will actually on the preferred name, they'll type in DUI, drug court, DCP, which kind of tells whenever you do a search that the client belongs to the drug court program or DUI program. So is there a way where you can where we can create an area that probably puts the person, what program are they in or on at the time of receiving services? So you want to identify or so when the person is first entered into service, you want to be able to choose from a different track if they're drug court or if they're MAT. Is that what you're saying, Mike? Correct. Correct. That's not we don't we don't catch that here in this demographic page. That would be very helpful because we have two different reports that we have to do. So we can disaggregate the data like that and we can disaggregate the population that we're working with like that. Correct. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Thank you. No, that's that's basically what we want to do. And I'll be very helpful. So whoever sees or is working on this client is able to see that this client, you know, it's receiving services through like, you know, your drug court program, DUI court program and mental health program. OK, great. Thank you. I don't know if Reggie wants to do something. He wants to see better, different change from his perspective, also from his side. No, in terms of this demographic page, we just basically pivot from whatever's in their profile. So the information we need is used is typically there. I can't think of any gaps. Yeah, it's a very thorough demographic page. So it's a lot of information once we go step by step on here. You can see this. What would you say in other parts of the system when you're thinking about the therapist and putting the information, do they need any additional things, Reggie? Off the top of my head, no, no. Minor, can you think of any additional things? No, no. No. Like I said, it's very well developed. It's just off the top of my head. No, not at this time. I don't know. Did you guys need a section there for group therapies to identify that the client was part of a group therapy or how you identify that currently? No, the admin, when there's a group that takes place, the admin, however they put those names in the system, we're able to go in and select one client that was in that group and the entire list of participants in that given group are listed there. So we're able to that makes it pretty easy. But is the group logged as as an instance of itself? The session. Can we go in and look at it? You said can we go in and look at it? Yeah. How do you log your groups? I mean, I know about the individual people who happen to be in the group, but do you have an instance of the group that's like the group session? Let me kind of say yes and no, because I'll go into one encounter, person A, and there's a there's a box. Once I finish that note on person A, I click this box and each one of those participants for that group is in that box. All I do is click on each name to write my note. But do you have them in a group setting? Are they grouped together or are you pulling one and then that one gives you the access to the other ones? I don't know if I wish I could show. I'm using this as an example as I look at this. This line says patient group. I hit that drop down box. Each person that attended that group would be in that box. So someone would have set up the group combination before then? That's correct. OK, so I think that's what we're trying to ask. Yes. Is it admin that sets that up? They are. Yes. OK. And how do they set that up? That I don't know. We submit a list of it. We submit a group roster to them. OK. And they contact us to let us know that those that those names have been set up. OK, perfect. Right. All right. So it's the admin. So Tamar, Diana, let's just note that for this this program that the admin sets up the group. On the Dr. Cloud side, we have a workflow on the Dr. Cloud side that logs groups. Right. And you can see this. There are two formats to create appointments when it comes to that. So I'm showing you on the on the on the computer right now. So whenever we create an appointment, you see, we have two options, either to create an individual appointment, which is the first top right now. And also what Mr. Reggie was saying, whenever we create a group, we have a group appointment. And this is where basically admin will do. They'll get the names of that group. The clients participating in that group beforehand, they already know who they are. They'll go ahead and create the appointment for whichever group, a specific group they have based on the services, the location. And then they'll add the members of that. So that's how it's the group rosters created by admin. OK. Yeah. OK, that's perfect. How is the area, Reginald or Maynard? How is the area or the section currently in this system on their medications and e-prescribing? It's do you have an area there that you are able to enter the medications that the patient is on and all that? We do. We do. We do. I'm only asking because I'm one of the enhancement requirements. The behavior of health had they needed the medication module. No, we have a module where we can and where we can enter the medications and the doses. Can you show us that? But the module where you enter the medication and the doses is on the patient profile, right? It's not just by program, correct? That's correct. By patient. Yes, by individual patient. OK, that's actually great. So we'll have that same functionality in doctor. It's already there. And as you can see on the screen, that's as Mr. Reg is talking about. That's the part that gets filled out by whoever is doing the provider, which was registering all that information of their medication. So so in essence, the intake, I'm going to call them an intake worker. Just bear with me for a second. Right. So the admin person is the one that really sets up all of this when it pertains to the patient docket. Right. So and then you guys just do the mental health session side. You lock that piece. Right. But there is a workflow where it's a handoff basically of an admin setting it up for you. And then you're using that data to do to complete your work. Right. Quick question about the referral piece. How do you get that now? And I'm sorry, I was dealing with some logistics because I'm in the office. I might have missed it. I just I'm asking for a reason. Do you get it in an email? How you get the referrals from drug court? Typically, it's an email just containing that client's contact information because those clients can come from the community or the jail. Also, the community or the jail or the jail. That's correct. OK. When they come from the community, are they coming to a specific provider? No, no. They're just coming for screening to have a screening done. And that's done by hard copy paper because they're not a part of our program. Let me ask you, Reggie, is that referral from the community still someone who is involved with the court? That's correct. Yes. OK, so that's still the link. I think that's what I'm getting at. It's still someone from the court. So, yeah, yeah. All these people are coming from the courts. OK. I think. When we explore and this is a question for the doctor cloud team, because that's the reason I was asking. Are the referral is the referral module an external? Like, how does that work? Can I send someone a link and they send referrals? So it's like, how does the referral module in Dr. Cloud work for external providers, not internal? That's how it works. Yeah. You can provide any referral source or your Web site. You can have it. There'll be a link there. And then they just click the link and fill out the form. And that generates the referral that comes into Dr. Cloud, sends out a notification. to the provider, whoever providers need to be notified that that referral has been received. And then they can take it from there, either determining eligibility or bringing them in for services and then just say, I want to create a record from that referral. Okay. So for, so Reggie and team, do you have to provide information back to the court regarding the sessions and what happened? Like what is provided back? Is it a note, a narrative, confirmation the person is there, completion of session? You mean after that initial referral, initial contact? Yes. There's a summary written. I submit a hard copy for the courts to look at and as well as the summary, along with the recommendation. Is that pulled from NextGen? No. NextGen has no involvement with this at all. All of this is hard copy. Oh, so it's a form basically that you have to send back to them in a certain way. That's correct. Well, I send them the form back with, it's a template, it's a screening tool. I send that back along with a narrative and my recommendation. But that form is from them or did we create it? It's actually one that we selected. We didn't create it, we selected it, it's just a tool. But not in NextGen, right? No. What's the name of the tool and can we put the tool in the newsletter? So I would have to find it, it's actually, I know the acronym, but I don't know what the letters mean. It's TAP, T-A-P. T-A-P. Yes. I think I know what those are, but okay, because there's more than one type of forms that you send in and out of the Justice Department with different TAPs. I think there are some modified TAPs, I've seen other ones out there, slightly modified. Okay. So you use a tool to communicate back the information to them, but it's a hard copy, you say, you have a physical form. That's correct. It's tobacco, alcohol, and prescription. Do you email it to them? That's what it is? Go ahead. Tobacco. Okay. What did you say, Dr. Nelson? It's tobacco, alcohol, and prescription. Prescription. Right. So it probably is a tool that's used within that space to communicate back and forth. But the information on that, right, is the same information that you will have in your clinical system, correct? Because you wouldn't have anything different. That same narrative you're sending back that, you know, it's the same, right? I am not, it's the same as what? As the person's file. Because you're reporting on the person coming in, correct? I'm reporting on a candidate. That person may not come in. This is a screening process. Reginald, a file is not created for the person, and this information that you are responding or sending back is not getting attached to any chart? No, not at all. Where do you guys save that? We save them just as a matter of record, but consider it as any outpatient program. It's just a screening tool that you're using this information to determine whether this person meets criteria for your program. So that person you may never see again. But where do you save that information? We just keep it on file. We keep a file of it. One of our admin people keeps a file of it, and I keep a digital copy. Okay. All right. I think what we'll do- And part of that reason is because the majority of the people are accepting, but there's a fair number that are not accepting. Mm-hmm. Okay. Is there a way to determine- We have to have a way to capture that information in the system, Donal, that that information needs to be entered. Yeah, but I think how I'm going to do it, and so in the essence of time, right? So for the July 1st, it's data for data, right? But I don't want to lose the thread of what needed to be connected for this process. So we're going to circle back, Arnicia, right, on this piece of the work. But I think what's in the system is what really going to go over to Dr. Cloud. This other piece we'll have to do after July, but we still need to discuss it to figure out the actual workflow with other interconnected things. We're going to change our workflow also so that other people can enter the stuff, that it doesn't just rely on admin to do the initial putting in information. So I just wanted to have that in the forefront, that we're also going to... It's not going to just be limited to admin. It would be anyone, like the therapist could enter the information. Okay. Just to note, to be clear, when that tap is completed, these people are not our clients. So that's why that information isn't in NextGen. They're not our clients. They're not even being admitted to our program. That's a screening tool. But it's a... Let me put it this way, Regina. So it's a conclusion of a referral that was sent to you, right? So a referral was sent to you, and that tap is for that referral, right? Whether the person get in or not, right? Say that once again. So the tap is in response to a referral that got initiated anyway. That's correct. That's correct. So even though they're not your client, they're HHS client, because any referral come to us is an HHS client, right? A client don't only mean like, oh, you're going to serve them, right? A client can also be, okay, someone referred a person to me. That screening, and I just want to clarify this, that screening is still our work, right, Regina? So if we were charging someone for that work, we're like, hey, this is what I did for these referrals that came in. They're not our clients, but they're a contact that got sent to HHS. And then we're saying yes or no, we're going to take them. So the word client is not necessarily only service, right? It could be... And the reason why we probably want to make it more digital too, is that that customer already in our system, right? So that customer referred to you, probably already in our system somewhere. So you would only need to respond to that particular screening to send back to drug court. When you send it back to them, it's emailed though, right? That's correct. It's scanned and emailed. Okay. Right. But it doesn't... I think for this specific situation that they are currently having, Regina, when the person, as you stated, most of them stay with us, when they stay with us, this advice that you are giving them on the note, right, or the area where you are commenting whether they are appropriate for the program or not, is that file updated or uploaded to their chart at that moment, or it still stays in other files? It still stays in other files. It doesn't become a part of the official record, if that's what you're asking. Yeah. That's fine. Because it is part of their records, but okay. Yeah, that's fine. I think what Regina is saying that this piece of the process, a completely separate process whether or not they get in or get out, right? That's correct. Yeah. But if we digitize this, then we don't need to worry about it being in the file or not, right? The ones that come in will have it in the file. The ones that don't will just be a contact with an instance in the system. That's it, right? So, that's how I'm thinking through. In terms of the other side, where we send the information, we send it to a general inbox. Do you have a general email as to how we can link it? Is that a question posed to me? Yes, yes. Sorry, Regina. When we send it through email, it's a general inbox, not a person, right? No, it's sent to a person. It's sent to the coordinator of drug court, of problem-solving courts, because that information is not sent alone. When she sends it to the entire court team, it's attached to some other records because a variety of information is taken into consideration to determine that person's eligibility for drug court. So, that's a part of the puzzle or part of the package, I should say. Okay. I think what we'll do is, this conversation, and I think most of the pieces that you're showing here, we do have a space for it in Dr. Cloud, right? And then, all the administrative referral communication between the referee and us, we will do that as a part of the new workflow after July 1st. Make sense, Regina? Dr. Neverson, that make sense? Yes. Yes. So, we won't have it. I can't change that process because it's a few pieces, and Tamar is going to be working with you guys on that. There's a few pieces that need to happen. I won't be able to do that for July 1st. Okay. So, come July 1st, we will still be doing paper taps? Yes. And then, we're going to convert that process to something electronic using the referral piece as in Dr. Cloud and other processes. I don't want to go and change part of it and go, oh, they can now send us referrals electronic, right? Because if they do, then you literally have to change your workflow now, right? And I don't know if we're ready for that. I don't want to do it piece by piece. Make sense? Yes. We're not comfortable with that? No. It's not a comfort level, it's more just understanding, is that so? Yeah. I can get the referral piece, but so, yes, I get it. I know that a lot of EHRs have already built in assessments and TAPS is like one of the... I'm curious to see if that's already built into Dr. Cloud, just like a depression screen and a PHQ-9, some of those come already prebuilt because they are typical assessments that are used. And so, I'm not sure if this is a tool you have to build out? No, no, no. It's not even a tool to build out. It's actually... Yeah. So, we can do one of two things. I can do the exploration and see what the shift will be, right? So, if Dr. Cloud, right, and you can send me the TAP, I don't know, if Dr. Cloud have the TAP, which they probably do, okay, and we do that internal, I now have to get with Drug Court to say, okay, you're now sending a referral digitally, right? So, it's not just us that's accepting a new workflow, it's our partner that's accepting a new workflow. You get me, Dr. Neverson? So, I'm like, it's not just us that's going to change, it's them. Yeah, I do. I just, you know, and I'm willing to wait. You know, wait. I was just wondering if they could. We don't have to wait. If you think within two months, because the Dr. Cloud team, they don't have to do much to make this happen. I'm more concerned about we changing the workflow for not just ourselves, but another partner in a short time, and we can do this if you think they'll be willing to just go, okay, you now need to send us electronic referrals, and you're going to get electronic referrals back. No, no, no. I was, my only thing was the referral process. I was disconnecting the referral process with the TAPs assessment, so if they still did their referrals through the email, and we got this information, and then we were able to enter the client information into Dr. Cloud, do the TAPs assessment, do Dr. Cloud, maybe once we get that assessment downloaded and email it back until we can get the referral part electronic. That's all I was saying. So, again. I think it's worth a try, though, to talk to the court, because this is information we're going to have to report out to the court, I mean, to the grant, all right? Because they're going to want to know the ones that we didn't accept into the program. Right. So, the TAPs form would be our best way to gather that information. So, maybe you and I can meet with their leadership, Dr. Neverson, and ask a question. So, we can explore it, okay, Arnecia and team, we'll explore what it will take to do this change. And it'll probably be like, listen, July 1st, we're doing it this way, and we just make it work, right? We'll deal with the follow-up. The thing I want to make sure of, though, when we do something on paper, it's a different time than when we start doing electronic, right? Because if for now, we do TAPs for everybody, right? So, some people that come in and some people that don't, right? So, that's on paper. If it's electronic, no, everyone is a contact in that space, and everybody gets put in initially so you can do the TAP, right? So, that space, that body of work, no change, right? So, I want you guys to think through this, right? And it's fine, the technology will be there. I just want to know that if we do this, then we're ready for also make that shift between a paper to a system thing, which don't mean less time. I'm always very clear about this. It doesn't always mean less time. It can be more time, just a little bit more efficient over time, right? But I think we can explore that. I think, and the Dr. Cloud team can let us know if the TAPs are available. They probably are. And if you guys can send us which TAPs you're using for this process. Also, what would that look like for TAPs that are done in the jail setting or some other location? What do you mean? So, I actually can, there are TAPs that are completed in the jail setting. Excuse me, sometimes at other treatment locations as well. So, I'm wondering how would them? You mean physically? Are you just doing those on paper? You mean physically? I'm sorry, Chris. You mean physically, Reginald? Yeah. Yes. So, we just bring our computer. I am sorry. I am confused. I'm sorry, Reginald. No. So, if the TAP is available electronic, you don't think you can do it in the jail on the computer? I mean, we could. I've never attempted to take a computer in the jail when I go. Okay. So, you think about physical. Okay. I used to bring the computer during the flu seasons that I was doing the flu vaccines inside the jail. They did check in the entrance and they check everything that I am carrying, but I was allowed to enter the computer and they would give me a section where I don't have to access the jail all the way inside, but I was able to be in an area where it was secure to have it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. They used to allow me to do that. I've done it before, but then I did it on a different way, so I wasn't going to tell you if I... I didn't know what your process was. Like, were you going to be sitting with an inmate completing this thing and was it okay for the person and you and the computer to be there? That is something that we can actually find out, Reginald. Yeah. I'm typically in the professional visiting area, but I just didn't know what the policy was regarding taking a tablet or computer in the jail. I just didn't know. We can get you an answer on that. Worst case scenario, if you do it... Sometimes people are better with writing their stuff down and then entering it in the computer. It's an extra step, but I mean, that can always... If you did it that way and entered it in, once you got back to your docking station or your computer, that's an option, too. We can get you an answer. We can just talk to the jail leadership. I'll talk to the chief and we can talk to the director. I'm sure it's not a problem. They'll let us bring stuff in if we just set it up with them in advance. Yeah. So, okay. So, our route right now, we... And Chris, I'm sorry I cut you off. You were about to say something. I think I wanted to ask you, in terms of this type of assessment, are they in the systems? Can you show us what they look like? The TAPs or... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I was looking... We have something, but I think it's under a different name. But yeah, if you could send us the TAPs that you're using, that would be great. Okay. If you can show us what you have, even if it's under a different name, that'd be great. Chris. Reginald, can you get us the TAPs today? I'm literally looking for it now so I can send it out. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And in the email you're going to send me, can you tell me what's sent with the TAPs? Just it. Just it? Okay. Just it, along with my narrative, which is a recommendation, yes. Okay. But that is on the TAP itself, the narrative? It is, yes. There's a... The last page of it, I believe, is page 20. You'll see there's an opening. I think it's for comments. And I handwrite whatever the narrative is, whatever the narrative is, along with the recommendation. Okay. While Chris is trying to get online to show us that piece, when... For those that come into your program, do you have to then report to the jail? What's your frequency on reporting to the jail on the person that you're actually seeing now? So what's the TAP? What was the question? So for someone that's actually, you're going to be serving, what is your requirement to report back to the jail or the court regarding the person going through your process, or is there any? If I'm understanding your question correctly, there is no requirement. I simply make contact to a person in the jail requesting to see that individual. They give me approval. I go see the person, and that's it. That's my last contact with the jail about that person. Oh, okay. So the referral comes, the TAPs go back, and then you just start your process. There's no... Okay. There's no requirement for the person when they end your sessions or a group of sessions to send something back to the referee. No, right? Not in the jail. After that is when I start communicating with the courts and the other stakeholders in that way. Okay. Just to go see the person, or... I think I'm trying to get at, what's your responsibility to the referee once you're seeing the customer? My... I was just going to say, so Reggie, once we have accepted this person, is there any type of documentation or summary or report outs on that client or that person to the courts, and how often, and what is it? So I think if I'm understanding your question, we don't necessarily... We're not the decision makers as to whether this person will come in. We send a... That's why I keep using the word recommendation. We recommend the ultimate decision maker is the judge. So there are a lot of factors taken into account as to whether that person will be in drug court, legal, behavioral, a lot of factors. So that person is discussed at a meeting and a decision is made by the judge as to whether this person will be admitted or not. I don't know if that's answering your question. Yeah, but once they are, so the judge says, okay, you're admitted. So now that that person is admitted and we start providing the services, do you have to... How often do you have to report out to the judge? Do you have to report out to the court? What do you give them to say, this person is successfully attending, here's the update, that type of information? There are a number of modes of communication with the judge about any given client, but in terms of frequency or standards, there's a recurring meeting every Thursday, a pre-court meeting where every person on that docket, the judge is asking for basically a progress report with respect to that person. And whoever is seeing them on our side is one of those people, right? That's correct. The entire team, really. And that's a verbal report, not a written report. It's not a written report, it's a verbal report. Are these sessions logged in the person's file? No. No. There's no document. That's what I was asking. Are they normally scheduled? Are they on a regular schedule? You will know for this client, it's every Thursday at this time. Is it a regular schedule that you know about? No, it's a court docket and how they determine their docket, I have no idea. That's distributed. strictly from the legal side, and we're only providing reports on those people who are due on the docket that given week. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. By the way, you should have received the TAP too. Yes. Hi. I just have a quick question. So I heard about TAPs. Is there any other form or any other mandated form or process that you have to do for drug court? Anything else that we need to know? Maybe another form or a format? I'm putting it in the chat right now to make the request so that they send us all the forms. Oh, okay. All the forms. Okay. Okay. I thought it was something else. Okay. Great. Thanks. Okay. Yeah. I actually, I don't have one that I can show right now. I don't have access to the one that I was thinking of. So I'll have to set that up for a different file. Okay. Chris, I'm sending... Actually, I'm going to post it here before I put it in the... Well, I can't post it here. I'm going to put it in our folder inside the SharePoint under this program, the TAPs. Okay? Okay. Great. The TAP template. Actually, let me see. We've got just a little bit of time. I want to share my screen and show it. Is that okay, Reginald, that I share my screen and show the TAPs? No, it's not private. That's fine. Yeah. This is Sherry. So I just want to clarify, because we're seeing July 1. Is it July 1 or June 17? Sir? Well, so go live in the project plan was originally June 27th, but we pulled it in a week to June 17th. So we're not last minute going live. Okay. So it's June 17th. Okay. So my question for Dr. Cloud real quick is, based on what Reginald was noting and going into the jail with a computer, putting that aside, can this application be accessed just using an internet connection? Or does it need to be a secure internet connection? And the reason why I'm making the distinction is because NextGen is not going to connect to McDonald's, for example. You have to have a secure connection in order to connect. So is that the case with Dr. Cloud as well? Yeah, we do the authenticating of the user via their login. So they can access it via any network's connection. Even McDonald's, for example, as long as they have an internet connection? Yeah, as long as they have an internet connection, they can access the system, as long as they can authenticate it. Okay. Thank you. So that really goes to your IT, the question. Yeah. And if IT is setting it up for you to allow to connect to Wi-Fi, so it's really connected to Wi-Fi at McDonald's. And if IT is saying, you know, such networks are okay, Dr. Cloud doesn't really, it's just a browser-based application. It's like accessing Google Mail, for example. Thank you. Microsoft 365. So we don't control that. It's IT that controls it. So this is what it looks like. It seems just like a screening form. And original, this, this is a, it's a screening, so it looked like it's client data, right? Not your assessments afterwards. That's correct. Okay. So this is all filled out with the client? That's correct. Yes. But it, Chris, I think you probably sense what I'm getting at. This is a client-facing, these are client-facing questions. So, Reginald, your, your population of individuals, they are, they, what's the computer-savvy level from your judgment? I don't need a perfect answer. I know what you mean. It varies. It varies. Okay. Okay. Okay. But they're on apps and stuff, too, right? You do get younger clients, middle-aged, yeah, okay. That's becoming a, that's a point of discussion right now in terms of age, yes, but we're not getting that. I mean, we're, we're typically getting mid-20s to mid-40s. Oof, okay, so that's- Are these files locked, or they're not, are they locked at somewhere in a safe place, or where are they saving these files? Because what I'm, this is a lot of information that we are asking from these people. They're digital, they're digitally kept. So we can, we can get to the policy stuff later. We'll talk about that later, but the other question, male, female, what's your population breakdown, Reginald? I don't know percentages, but I know more than 50% male. More than 50% male? I said more than 50% male. More than, mm-hmm, okay, okay, okay. Chris, a TAP is just really, to me, a generic screening tool. From what, if you guys can see the, from my screen, they're not, yeah, okay. Is it just, for example, screening, is that what it is? What'd you say, Chris? Sorry, I didn't hear. Is it, is it a drugs and alcohol screening, is that what? Yes, and yes, and I know if you look at it, there's some generic stuff that's not necessarily drug and alcohol related, right? But yes, if you have something that says drug and alcohol, it probably is this, probably sending me. I always characterize it as a, and abbreviate it, it's biopsychosocial. Biopsychosocial, okay. Oh, okay. So that's why I was not saying yes or no, Chris. Yeah, it's one of those, okay. So I'll, Chris, if you could do me a favor, when I send this in the form, if you can just respond to me to see if you have anything familiar, and if I can get a PDF, that'd be great. Yeah, sure. So you can print your templates, right? You can just send me a template. Mm-hmm, yeah. Okay. And by the way, the template that we selected is not something that someone mandated for us to collect. Mm-hmm. We chose it. We chose the best of what we could find in order to get the information we were looking for. Sure. Okay. Well, you didn't, this template, you didn't modify, right? This is- We did not. That's as is. That's correct. Perfect. So this is a next-gen template. Okay. So I have a quick question. Is there anything, you said, you know, what you found, is there anything that should be on the template that you would like, or is it this will suffice? It will suffice. Okay. Okay. We're just trying to collect that data and then analyze the data to see if it suits, if that person's suitable for the program. That's all. Okay. But mainly we want to be able to diagnose or make a diagnosis as relates to substance use disorder. Okay. Thank you. And I think the final thing before we leave today, Dr. Nervison, regional team, if you guys can send us your report, I think Diana is going to put some notes in the chat about sending us your report requirement. Yeah. Done. Done. Done and done. Done and done. If you can send us that, that'll be great. And also think through what you need to manage. You probably don't have it in next-gen right now, but like, okay, here's how I manage my work or my staff or my, you know, and I probably have to use a spreadsheet, anything like that. Anything else from the Dr. Clout side? I do have one question. Does Dr. Clout have electronic check-ins where you can enter the information when you have groups? Yes, absolutely. Yes, we saw that the other day with the other team. I know Ernesto. Yeah. There was another behavioral health team where groups and we, yeah, we did that. Thanks. The thing we haven't quite explored yet, and Ryan, I got to figure, it's the same thing I have, I'm drawing a blank on how to do it the most efficiently. It's the same thing with the forms, right? So I want to start exploring the patient portal capability, right? Because I think a lot of our intake is going to be mostly in that space, right? Because there's a lot of front-end work we do right now that we honestly do not have to, and I'm not talking about the population I can't read and write, because every time I say this, somebody tells me about somebody who can't read and write. I'm not talking about that population, right? But I don't quite know what's there, Ryan, to start giving some information to staff, but let's think through how we can explore that patient portal space. Okay. Yeah, it sounds good. I'll have the team kind of prep a demo. Let us know when the appropriate time in the group, the audience, is for it. Okay. We'll get it scheduled through summer. Okay. We should just do a walkthrough, right, of the whole portal? Yes, just a walkthrough, but I think our body of work, and this is where I don't know how we're going to do this, is how much of our templates that we have right now, we push to that space. Okay, say, for example, the taps, right, and this is not a good example, the client is just referred. They haven't gotten anything yet, right, but we want to say to a person, oh, you've been to the court, blah, blah, blah, here's the next step in your process. As an intake for further support, you know, can you fill out this information, right? We want to be able to push that. I need to do that with every intake form, like every form. Is there a way, in your system now, you have any forms that you know are associated with your patient portal site that we can, okay. I mean, a couple of our customers, they have like a set of intake forms that get pushed out, consents, release of information, et cetera, so yeah, we can, I mean, whatever forms we end up going with for your site will be the forms that we can push to your patient portal, but we can kind of show you what's in use today and see if any of that makes sense for you, sure. Okay, and when this goes back and we get partial data back, is there a way to then complete it? Like, because our customers are going to have to do this, I know that, with the adult forms. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead, Chris. Yeah, yeah, you can bring in whatever level of completion of the form into the Docker Cloud system in the encounter to finish filling it out and, you know, complete it. Okay. Okay. Good morning. Yeah. So, just to follow up a little bit on, I think, the thread that Charisse pulled, is, do we know whether the network, do we know? Do we know whether the network at the jail is a secure network as opposed to an open one? Does anyone know that? I don't know that. I can't. I can't. And I think it is secure, just like how we, because they did that at all the sites. It is a county network, right? Yeah, there's a county network that's there. Okay. Yeah. But I gotta, I gotta confirm if it's county public versus county us, right? Like, when we come to the building, we can, I have to confirm that, but I, and I can. Okay. Okay. Because that's important. Because you're saying that, I wanted to ask this question, but I didn't, but I'm gonna ask anyway, because what Charisse brought up, it's more like, okay, we will be able to access this from a secure network. Let's say that's the way we're going, but is our home network considered secure? Well, your home network is considered secure if you have, you know, a way to, to encrypt it. Yes. If you, and there is a way for systems to check to see whether the network that you're trying to access them is secure, is secured or not. But you won't need VPN, right? To get onto. You don't, you don't, you won't need VPN, or you may not need VPN. But if the, if the network isn't secure, most times for systems such as EHRs, they may prevent you from accessing it altogether, or they may limit the functionality that you have. No, that, that's not necessarily a Dr. Cloud issue, but I mean, if they had that feature, great. If they don't, we just have to make sure that we are, when we are accessing it, that the network that we are accessing it from is always a secure network. And that, I think why Charisse made the reference to McDonald's is that you can go in there and, hey, you're, you're connected and to something and you can surf the internet, etc. That means that whatever it is that you're doing is exposed to anyone who wants to look. Right. So, I'm not, I'm not, this is not being critical of whether Dr. Cloud does it or not, I'm just saying that we, as the HHS, we are the ones that should make sure that if we're going to do that, that we do it from a secure network. Just to clarify, how is NextGen accessed today? Is it like you have to connect to the county network every time and be behind the firewall to access NextGen? No, but it doesn't, it doesn't allow you to connect if you're not on a secure network. Okay. Correct. Yeah. And the current version of NextGen, it looks like, is a desktop application. Right. And, you know, Dr. Cloud EHR is a browser-based application. Is browser-based. So, it goes to IT on how they, you know, whether they allow the laptop that is configured to connect to public networks, so to speak. Well, yes, that's one way we can prevent it. And that's why I asked the question. Yeah, and then, you know, we have some controls within Dr. Cloud EHR, which, you know, we can limit access from IP addresses, for example. So, even if you are on a public network, if you're allowed to connect to a public network and you can VPN into the office, then we can limit access to Dr. Cloud EHR from, you know, IP addresses that are connected only through the county offices, if you will. It is, there are options on the Dr. Cloud EHR side on where to connect from. As far as the connection to the EHR itself, we use SSL, so it's never over open. It's not, you know, it's always encrypted. So, the connection is like, you know, just like you're connecting to your bank account, it's connecting to Dr. Cloud EHR through the same security. Yeah, I figured that, but I'm talking about the network itself, right? How you get onto the network, if you're just, that's what we're talking about. Yeah, and then, yeah, and because we are a browser-based application, we don't have that access to control. Yeah, sure. I just want to say that we are not allowed to upload the documents. Maynard already tried to upload the TAB document, and I also tried to help him, but I'm not allowed to upload it. No, that's fine. I'll put it in the, that's what I said. Yeah, I'll put it in the folder. We'll put it on the SharePoint. Okay. Yeah, let's put it on the SharePoint. We'll put it there. Perfect. And then, if we cancel the access for users in Dr. Cloud when we are remote, most of us work remotely, or we move from one area to another, or we work from home, and we will not have access to that system, if that's the case. No, I don't think that was the issue. I think it's a more secure access remote, is what they're saying. What I want to say, though, and this is also for Selwyn, this is not just a Dr. Cloud thing. We have other tools here, which should be under the same, we access it the same way. Yes, but we were talking about detail, and that's why the question came up, is that how do people, if they are allowed to access it, is it just an open network, like a public network, as opposed to a county network? When we go, Dr. Jones, when we go to the jail services, and Jamila was there two weeks ago doing an inspection on an audit in Monier's department, and she doesn't have to enter any other network. She just go there, open her equipment, and it connects directly to the county network. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you for the extra five minutes. We are going to set up something with you, Reginald, and Arnecia, your team, to get through that workflow, to see what we can do in the system for the Go Live, for this program. Okay? Okay. Thanks to everyone. Chris, Ryan, I'll put the tab in the, and if I don't, you'll probably get an email from me with it, but I'll put it on the SharePoint. Okay. Very good. We have a couple of things we owe you, too, so we'll be sharing links today. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Dr. Dunbar. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Bye, everyone. Thanks. Have a great day.  Bye. Bye. Bye.",
