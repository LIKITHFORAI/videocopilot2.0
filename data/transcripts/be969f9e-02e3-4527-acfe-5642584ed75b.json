  "text": "Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Oh, hello everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Well, that came fast. Went from morning to afternoon in just a split second. Agreed. Hello everybody. Hello. Good afternoon everyone. Hi everybody. Good afternoon. Looks like the majority of our group is here so we can go ahead and get started. Thank you all for attending this workflow meeting. These meetings are recorded. If any of you all have any objections to that, please take. Please discuss that with Dr. Nambar and she'll tell you how to proceed forward. I'll pass the mic to Dr. Nambar to give you guys a little more information and then we'll move forward with the meeting. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for joining. I appreciate this. Everyone from your side is here. Right. It's not going to be based on who's going to walk us through. The system. So Karen is running late. I just noticed on the invite that Liz wasn't invited. I forwarded it to her, but I'm not sure that she will be able to attend or not. So. But Karen, she said she should be here in like 10, 15 minutes. OK. So for this this session, we really wanted to just see field for field what you were putting into the actual next gen system currently. Right. JC, if we could just start with your process while we while other people come in about, you know, your work, what you do, how you get your clients, your referral. If there's any mandated reporting information that you need, like how how is your work done in your space? That is a good question. So these clients and FIS. So it's two different programs, FIS and the whole base team. The FIS team is 100 percent referred by the Department of Juvenile Services. So they all come through DGS. We get a referral that comes to Liz, our supervisor, supervisory therapist. Who then reviews the case, make sure it's appropriate for the program, and then assigns that to one of the two therapists that are in this particular program. What does FIS stand for real quick? The Family Intervention Service, I think, is the S. So, yeah, it's service. It's. So it's like I said, it's primarily for Department of Juvenile. Well, it's 100 percent juvenile justice clients that are referred that the juvenile justice system believes that they would benefit from intensive family and individual counseling plus case management. Yes. And is there a limitation on the actual service time frame? There's not a limit, per se. We try to keep it nine months or so, but it really is up to how long someone is active in the juvenile justice program. There are times when as soon as DGS is finished with them, that the client leaves services. But then there are times when the client will continue with us. But they're not they're not currently incarcerated. They're just in. No, it's the community based services. So both of these. The reason why these teams are kind of linked together is the home based team. The HBT is also community based therapy. So it's in home therapy with kids primarily through the child welfare team. OK. And for FIS, do they come to you or you go to them also? Both. We primarily go to them. It's community based. So it's primarily us going to the community, to their homes, to their schools, to other locations to meet with them. OK. And the therapy sessions happen in those locations. Yes. OK. So it's all off. It's mostly off site. Mostly off site. It's not all off site, but mostly off site. Yeah. Do you do group therapy? We do group as well. Yes. OK, well. In terms of grouping, how do you actually organize your group therapy process? How are those cases assigned? How are how are the work the workers that work on them? And do you work with other providers in other areas when you're doing your group therapy? So the group therapy is closed just to those participants. So it isn't open. It's not like a drop in, but they are psychoeducational groups. So they're not necessarily therapy groups, but they're educational around anger management primarily and just affective coping skills and how to manage their aggression appropriately. What was the first part of your question again? I'm sorry. How would it organize like is one case worker that manages a case for a group therapy? Like how does how is that dynamically? How is that set up? Yeah. So if it's if it's appropriate for them to attend group, we just you know, because it's a such a small group, it's really two therapists and a supervisor that they sort of cross refer and have them attend. There's not like an official enrollment, so to speak. There's not like a referral needed. It's just like, hey, so and so would benefit from your group. Oh, OK. So there's there's no appointment made or scheduling for the plants. Yeah. For this. So these are it's the group is for folks that are already enrolled in FAS. So there's not a separate enrollment process to get into the group. OK, so. But what about the session time? Like how do you coordinate that with the clients? Yeah. So we have the for for group. It's just sort of it's you know, here's the time that group occurs when we do it. We don't always run group. It's not always we don't always have enough participants that would benefit or that would participate. But when we do, we just say group is Wednesday at six. Here's what it is. Get over here or that is something that we'll do primarily in person. We've tried to do it remotely. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But we do a lot of stuff, a lot of that stuff in person. OK, so it's kind of an informal. Yeah, it's not therapy. It's psycho and so it's really just it's a lot of information distributed out to the clients. It's not necessarily a process group. Oh, I see. OK, so it's it's. How does this document it then in next gen? Like it's just a group. A group session is charted. Is that what it is? And is it charted in each person attends the group? Yeah. And it's not billable because it's psycho and so. Right. Yeah. So how are the notes done for the group sessions? I will let Karen just got here and I will let Karen talk about the. Hey, Karen. Hi there. Did you care about how the group is? So you are you unleash Jason and me on poor Jason and he's like, really? You never tell me about this lady. So I was asking a lot of questions about the group. I'm so shocked. Just friendly and helpful. I can't imagine what. No, no, I just you know me. I always try to ask a whole bunch of detailed questions, but we were trying to I'm trying to get a flavor of how next gen is used to chart the group sessions. Right. I can't. I think we kind of know what the therapy sessions are. One on one are like. Right. The group is what I'm not as familiar with. And I want to see how you guys manage that both in and outside a mixture. So that's a great question. I we have in in the clinics we're not using. We haven't been consistently using them. So every time I forget because it's been like a year or something since we've done. But basically we create a group in next gen and then so we schedule the whole group in for that group time. This is how I was trained to do it. Can you show us? No, we just want to know. I don't know that I remember. Show you how to do it, frankly, because. I can look for whatever guidelines I had on it, but it's been so long since I've done it that I don't I don't feel comfortable trying to guide you through that. Here comes Liz. Maybe she will have a better sense of it. But typically you schedule you you schedule the group with all of the clients in that group in session and then you have group therapy. There's a group therapy note that has like a one version is or one part of it is for like what was discussed in the group as a whole. And then you can have whatever is related to that individual specifically. But Liz, we were doing the tag team. Hi. Sorry to be running a bit late. Yes, we were just talking about groups. And Richard was asking about the process of documenting groups. And I was talking about how we've been trained to do it a long time ago, but I don't know if you have a different way of documenting it. Yeah, I'm documenting it in NextGen. Yep. We were advised not to document it in NextGen. So we don't do any for the groups that we run for FIS. We don't document in NextGen. And part of it is because the the participants in the group are not always psychotherapy clients. So they're program participants, but it's a psychoeducational group that is not billable. So we're documenting participation and attendance separately. Where do you do that now? Do you do a spreadsheet or? Yes, in a spreadsheet. Yes. OK. Can you and you can redact the names if you can. You can send the spreadsheet to me with just the type of data. I just want to see how it's documented there. Absolutely. Yeah. And by all means, all these all these groups are run with individuals that's already registered on the FIS. Yes, through the FIS program. Absolutely. They're referred to anger management specifically. Yes. OK. So if they have all of them clients that we have, I think that's what Rachel is trying to get to. If there are clients that are participating under our office for services. So DJS refers us in multiple capacities for therapy, which individual or family and for groups. Sometimes an individual participates in both of those. Sometimes an individual participates in just group. I see. OK, OK. And you say family. Do you do family sessions also? Yes. Oh, and you would consider that a group, correct? No, we consider it a psychotherapy service that we build under family with or without a client. OK, perfect. Can you show us how you do that for the family grouping of a better word? Is that possible? In NextGen? Yes. You do that in NextGen. OK. Yeah. So it just it's a psychotherapy note that looks the exact same as an individual note. OK. And the designation for family is just related to the billing. Oh, OK. So in terms of charting for that group, it's just I think what I was thinking is like, OK, this is a family group. Are they all together under an encounter? Like, how is it done? Yeah. So I think it's tricky because it's multiple. It can be multiple people when we're doing a family session, but we don't really consider that a group. We really document the same way as a psychotherapy session with even just one person. And then we make we make a billing designation about what type of session, which may or may not be how many people were in attendance. I see. OK, so. So it's a family. The family is on the billing. The family indicator is on the billing side, not necessarily on the encounter side. OK, well, are these groupings when you set them up for the family? Is it just a head of household, at least that's under the case of parent? Sometimes the only way that family members or siblings or whoever may be involved in a session is included in our next jump is under there. There's a tab. There are two places there's in the. Comprehensive assessment, there is a place to list resources. And sometimes whoever the bio parents are that are listed in the demographics or the caregivers that are the custodians in the demographics, there might be additional caregivers, foster parents or grandparents that are caring for them. So then there's an additional place in the comprehensive assessment to list them as resources. And so that carries over into other templates. I see. So in terms of because this one's available service, who who is the head of household on this one in the main chart? When it depends on who comes in and I might even have to. Check with our admin and ask how he's been doing it lately, but how he does it for those in care, a lot of for my programs, a lot of the children are under the custody of the department. So the foster parents are not the head of household in terms of that. My understanding is that designation is more about who to hold accountable for insurance billing. And we're usually. You know, not putting the foster parents or right as the head of household. So the only time we would put the primary caregivers is if the children are with their parents and they have Medicaid and they're in residence with their parents. But if they're in a different setting, we're not putting I don't I have to check with our admin to find out what his default kind of household is for that. OK, if you can post this back to us, that would be great. Lizbeth, in terms of the because what I want to get to today and Chris, I don't know if you're ready to show us how the groups are done in Dr. Cloud, how that functionality works, how ideally it works. I don't know if we want to talk through HBT because HBT is it's just single therapy with individuals. Is that also family? I mean, my understanding is that I don't know about you, Karen, but I don't believe that anybody is documenting groups in NextGen. Are you all Karen? So there's two questions documenting and billing. So we have not been billing for groups and we have been document. So when we have had we run groups in the clinic where it's a hybrid. So we have active clients and then we have some clients from our wait list. So in those situations, we have been doing, you know, documenting either through a case management through a case management note. Because we had short, short term groups that we were sort of piloting, essentially. And so we would we would document in the case management note. For that particular client, but we have not been billing for groups when you. So that is something that that could be considered in the future for for active clients, but you can't. It was my understanding that you couldn't bill for some of the people in the group and then not bill for others. So that was the reason why we didn't proceed with billing at the time. You're saying sometimes the group is mixed with. Waitlist clients and current clients. Historically, yes. That's that's how we had had it done in the past. OK, Diana, I have a question. When the department received the recommendation not to enter the notes in NextGen because they were not billable services, is that because the service will trigger a bill if we put the notes in NextGen or it was a different reason? What was the reason behind that recommendation and who made the recommendation? Do you guys know? I want to speak to that, but I do think that part of the issue was that they weren't clients at the time. So we didn't have active cases for some of the ones that Liz is talking about in her groups. But I'll let you fill in, Liz. FIS, the group that is included in the program I supervise, it's of a different nature because some of the use are funded by a grant and not billable services. And so I don't know how much of that fact. I was advised by Viviana Azar to not document our groups. The groups have been running for over six years and they've never been documented in NextGen. So I don't know if it's because of the nature that it would create more non-billable services or that there are some youth who are only doing that 10 week anger management group and not getting other psychotherapy services. Yeah, I will talk with Jason and Arnesha about this later on. But I did review the grants with Viviana Azar two years ago and a year and a half ago. And there was no restriction there for us to add the notes in our system. So I wanted to understand what was the reason somebody would make that decision. But it's OK, we can work it out off record. Let's talk offline because I distinctly remember me having a conversation with the STs about this. So I will pull my notes. Exactly. Yes. No, I remember that you already talked to them about this. Yes. So we can just go ahead and move forward. Thank you. No problem. I was going to say I'll take my hand down. That was my comment because I remember the conversation with Viviana. So that was my comment. Thank you. So OK. So for. I don't know if you're able to show us how groups are charted or done in Dr. Cloud at this time where we have ad hoc groups, right? Because I know a lot of facilities do have this where it's ad hoc. They're not client. There's no intake yet, right? And we run sessions, right? So we do have these type of situations where we run sessions with clients and non-clients at the same time and the ones that are with clients and family group. Chris, is that something you could show us? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Just go ahead and share my screen here. So the way the group sessions work is you have it on the calendar and so you would go into the group session that's already created. And this has, you know, information about the group, including the facilitator of the group and any assisting staff for the group session. And then we have the date and then the recurrence of this group. So you can set it up so it recurs on the basis that you specify. So you can say every specific days of the week or you can say every, you know, last Wednesday of the month. Whatever that date happens to be, you can set up the recurrence for that. And then once that is set up, then you would come down here and then add people to the group. And you would do that by clicking this little profile icon up here. So this would allow you to search for clients in the system that you want to add to the group. And you would just start by typing the first few letters of their name. And then that will bring them up. You just select them. And then you can continue to search for additional folks and, you know, include as many people as you want. And then you can add them to the event once they're selected. And you can also remove them from here. So I can select somebody and remove them from the group. So this is how I would manage the roster for the group. And then once I've added the folks that need to be in attendance in the group session, then what I would do is when I'm performing the group, I can go ahead and put in some notes that would appear on the group note form that we're capturing. So we're filling out a form for the group session. And this data can pull into that form for us. We have a field for group notes. We have a field for the plan details, what we're covering in the session today. And then I would come down here and I can hover on the client's name to see a picture of them. So if somebody is facilitating the group and they're a substitute, they can see what the person looks like that the, you know, should be attending the group. And then when they're ready to check in, then they would select everybody that was in attendance that day. And then they would come up here and click attended and then click go. And that's going to check them all in. And because we are, we're documenting the group session in the group appointment, we are, you know, allowed, we're allowing you to be able to document for multiple people at the same time. But we also create an encounter for each individual that's checked in for the group session. And we have this red frowny face here that's giving me the status of the completion of the documentation for this individual. Now we have a couple of different group session forms that we can utilize, which allow us to document all of the attendees, you know, participation in the group session all at once. And I would access that by going up here to the notes button. And this generates a form that includes all of the participants in the group and allows me to type in my assessment of their participation in today's group session. And that group note information and plan information is automatically pulling into each of those. So I don't have to retype that. I can edit it if I want to, but it's just going to pull in automatically for me. So then I would say, go ahead. So you're saying we get a single session, a single session for each person that's attending and you also have a group session that's recorded too. Yeah. So this is, I'm actually documenting against each client individually when I'm adding documentation here, but we present it in this format so you can do it in a combined format. So you can enter the notes for everyone on this single form, or you can go into each form individually. So once I document this, I can go ahead and sign this, putting in my signature pin and then save that. And now we see that that person's note completion compliance icon is a green smiley face, letting me know that I have finished the documentation for that individual, but these others have not been done yet. But I can also click on this red frowny face and it will open up the form that we're using. This is just a simple DAP note for tracking the group session participation. So we would type in our assessment and sign it and save it. And that also would allow me to save the form for that person's participation in the group session today. Okay. Can you do a mass one for everyone either, or you have to do it one by one? Like if I want to, if everyone like, okay, everybody's participation was good. If I, can I do that for everybody or? You can do it from here. You would just type your text and then you can copy it all the way down. Okay. Can you add folks that's not in your client list? Yeah. So when I'm in the group session in that management, I can just go in and add whoever I want here and I can choose from all clients. And this is going to be all the clients that I have access to. I can add to the group. Okay. No, but I'm saying, no, no, no. So they're not registered. I haven't done an intake yet. Can I add a person that's not registered? Depends on what you mean by registered. If they're created in the system. Yeah. They're not created in the system yet. They're not joined. We don't have any information on them yet. So. Okay. So you can add, okay. You can add a walk-in, anything like that. And then if you don't select it, everybody else would be a no-show from when you were doing your attendance here. And you can also, yeah, you can also indicate, like, let's say for example, this person did not attend and you want to mark them as absent, you can say absent and then say go. And that will change their status to absent. And we can configure the behavior of the system when you check them in as absent or attended or refused or whatever these options you want them to be. We can configure the behavior of that when you check them in with that status. I see a number of hands up. So I just want to make sure. Jason. Okay. Yeah. Just one question and one comment. Is there a limit to how large the field can be under group notes or plan? Is there a limit to the characters? No, there's no, I mean, there is a, it's not a practical small limit. It's like 65,000 characters. Gotcha. Okay. And second, to your point earlier about, and what does it mean to be, like, enrolled or admitted? I think that, and that's a workflow thing that we can work on, but I wouldn't feel comfortable having someone in a group with nothing, with no information. If they're on a wait list, we have information on them that we should be putting in. So I think we would put them into the system and just not having enrolled them into a particular program and maybe they're sitting out there, but there would be something in the system at that point. No, they would have to be charted is what I'm saying, Jason, right? So they'd have to be charted. But some groups that get run in MoCo, right? People have anonymous walk-ins kind of, right? So that's what I was saying, thinking, but that would be outside the system anyway. So we know for this function, they have to be charted to be in. It's okay. Is there any way before Jamila, to Jason's point, I just want to tag on that. Is there any way to do a final attendance number check? Is that anywhere here? Because especially when we run large groups, the numbers, like sometimes you look at the group like, oh, 50 was registered, 20 attended, right? So is there anywhere on this dashboard to see just a quick view of that? Well, you can, I'm trying to think, you can print the roster, but in terms of seeing, I mean, we could easily give you a report that would say, you know, group name and number of people. In fact, we actually do already have that. It's a productivity report. So if I go in and look for the productivity of my clients or my providers, I can see in here, you know, how many folks attended the group. So see, this is a visit and we serve one client with that. And then if I come down here, I can actually filter this and say, by a group type of service. And then I can see there were two clients served by this group. But what we don't have is the total number of registered. Yeah. But we could easily add that if we, if you need that. Yeah. Yes. That would be great. Like seven out of 12 or something like that. Yeah. Okay. So, so sorry, Jamila. Before I forget the, on the provider, can you add more than, can you add multiple providers? Yeah. Yeah. You can add as many. So you have one primary and then you can add as many assisting as you want. Oh, so you can only add them in a system, but only one primary. I think that's what I wanted to know. You can't have one more than one primary, no. Yeah. So on the provider space, you're kind of only one person. And then in the assistance staff is where you have to put everyone else. Correct. Okay. So my question was along those lines. So let me ask you something. I don't know in this, this capacity, but if they want to invite the parent, maybe the parent, or maybe a law enforcement, is that a way, is that, would that go into assisting staff or is there distinctive roles like of who is attending the group? Is there a way to do that? Well, we only track, you know, registered clients as participants in the group. If, if there's guests in the group session, you could document that in the notes for the visit that, you know, so-and-so was also in attendance because you're not, you're not providing the service to them. You're providing it to the client. So the client notes would be what you're tracking. I mean, I get that, but for on our operational side, we, we, a lot of times can we work hand in hand with police. A lot of times you have to document specifically the other non HHS adults in the room, right? That is not a client, right? That's not participation on a client. So if, I mean, if there's any way we can put that distinctly in here, if you could just find out and tell us, because the notes is not going to help. Yeah, because you can't retrieve, you know, in terms of the notes, you know, it's basically free text. And we, you know, we say we try to retrieve the data. That may be difficult. Can't pull who was in the session. Yes. I see Ramesh is on this call. Ramesh, are you, are you available? Can you address that question? Yes. What was the question? So the question is they have, you know, community partners, police officers, or others that attended groups with the client and they wanted to be able to document that. So they're not a registered client in the system, but they're a participant who is in support of the individual attending the group session. And they wanted a way to, to be able to see who attended in, in addition to the client. I already added right now, is there like an attendance sheet? Are they on the roster? I'm sorry, Ramesh, we can't hear you. You broke up unless it's just me. Were you, were you asking? It sounded like he was asking how is it done now? Yeah. So we document them as we document the assisting staff. So we, so the, how we do sessions and not talking about behavioral health, but I know a lot of these sessions get run with multiple providers in the space. You, you document them not as customers, but as involved parties inside the sessions. Yeah. I was going to say there's a template and you can, you can add the names and then their role, you know, their role. That's what, you know, sometimes I see when I do audits of parent or law enforcement and what have you. So that's, you know, we're able to do that in one of the templates because that's pretty important for us to be distinctive. But you guys said you're not documenting groups in your current EHR? We, we do, but just, it looks like not in this particular FIS. No, for this particular program, but we are documenting groups. But we will, we will. So we will. Yes, we will. So please don't. Typically our other customers, the way they document who attended is when they personalized a note. That's where they usually document who attended along with the patient. They don't add them to the appointment itself. So. Yeah, but we do it completely different Ramesh, both on the social service side and on the, because this groups are also run on social service side, not just in therapy. And we do document because of auditing purposes, we have to know the adults in the room with, and it cannot be just in notes. So we have like an involved part because it's not, so we have the person's last name, first name, sometime badge number, their phone number, contact. Because in some instances too, there are support individuals for the the individuals in the session. Okay. But I don't know, we're just, we're just noting that now. That is something that, you know. Yeah. I mean, another thought I would have right now. Yeah, we won't support, we don't support that right now. Sounds like you're adding it to the attendance sheet. At least, or maybe, you know, whatever you call it, attendance sheet or roster or involved parties, along with the actual clients and patients, you know, the people that are present. Is that, is that right? Yeah, but they're not the clients. So I don't want to say that, oh, we're, yes, but they're not the clients. They're added a separate thing. Like in our case management system, we have a complete section for those individuals. Okay. Yes. Sometimes referred to as collateral contacts or. Yeah. Yeah. And, and honestly speaking, we, we sometimes need to pull the person specifically out as an actual contact, just like Liz was trying to say, for the individuals. But again, this is just something we're saying that we're doing. Obviously we're not documenting it in NextGen at this time, but it's something that we would, we would like you to explore where we can put it, any idea is what I'm saying. Yeah. There is a place to do scanned, to upload scanned documents. And so maybe for now that can be an option where you can, you know, if you're doing it outside of the system already, then you could scan that document and then attach it to the group session documents. And then, you know, who are all the involved parties at that time. But I think what we are saying right now is that we will be including that in the system. Like by the time we get Dr. Clow, they need to start doing the notes in the system. Yeah. And we're currently like currently in NextGen, there's a way for me to see if there's, you know, the parent or the law enforcement. So there's a way to do it. And just this particular, I guess with FIS, we will be documenting that, but in other programs, they are definitely documenting like who is at the meetings, you know, and sometimes we do have to retrieve the data as well. And it's not in notes. And it's not in notes. Yes, it's distinctive. You can pull it before. Chris, I know you had a suggestion. Sorry. Yeah, I was going to say we have a module in our form builder that allows you to indicate other contacts for this individual. And that could be utilized. I know it's in the form, but it's easy to run a report to say, okay, show me for all of these group sessions that people attended, who was also in attendance. And that could be just captured on the form, but it would be easily seen in a report. But that form is associated with each contact, right? Not the group. Correct. Ah, okay. All right. We'll table this, but I think what we'll try to do is show you exactly where we put it in NextGen, which we can't do now. Yeah, that would be great. But we'll show you exactly. Kumar? Yeah, she just said what I wanted to say. Just show them sometime, you know, how we do it in NextGen, and then I think Dr. Cloudtree will get an idea. Yep, sure. Exactly that. Thanks. Okay, anything else or any other questions on the group session documentation? In terms of as a manager, how would I see my group sessions that occurred for my staff versus others? How do I see that? Where is that? So when you are, I mean, are you looking for upcoming group sessions or past or both? No, so if I'm looking at my team's workload, my team's work, right? Their cases, whatever you call them in Dr. Cloudtree, right? And I say, oh, I've got five team members. Three of them has four group sessions, right? Like, is there a way to see that? Or is it only like a calendar view? It's a calendar view, but I can also see in my caseload view, I can see what my supervisees have in terms of assigned clients. And then if I have a requirement that I've set up in the system to say that if they're, you know, when they need to attend group sessions, then I could see the deficiency or compliance with that here in this column for the columns for those forms. I just, I also wanted to answer the question that came up in the chat. Yes, you can have additional signatures on the group notes forms. So it's co-signing or supervisor. Or I think that's okay. Any questions? The other option, you know, when you're looking at the schedule is I can do a search and I can say between the dates of, and then I can choose the provider whose schedule I want to see and then submit that. And that shows me all of their appointments in that timeframe. And then I can just look at those by clicking on each one and it would show me the details of that appointment. So that's the other way you could do that is using the search. I think from a management standpoint, it's for us when you have like five therapists, six therapists, right. It's not by therapists that you want to see. It's honestly, sometimes by week, right. Or, you know, sometimes someone is going out and you're like, okay, I need to, I need to look at this thing from a cross time perspective by employer. Like that kind of dynamics is what I'm looking for in terms of the management space. Cause it's not that easy to see. Okay. You can, yeah, you can multi-select the providers and then it would show you each of their weeks and you just scroll down to see each week of that provider on the schedule. Okay. Sorry, Jimmy, I have a question. Okay. Oh gosh. I was going to ask that. Oh, so say if someone walks out of a group, cause I had a couple of times, is there to depict that? I know they have to check-in, check-out with someone who were in the group and maybe they didn't stay the whole time. Is there a way to annotate that? How would you annotate that? Yeah, you would just go to that group note, and then you can indicate the end time and have it be earlier. When I go into this group session and I go into this person's note, I can actually annotate that or put in a different end time for them. Once it loads up here. Although this form doesn't track start and end time, but if we had start and end time on here, you could put in a different end time. You have to put that on the big group form and then it gets copied here. On that group that you set up initially, the start and end time would need to be there, then it gets copied here. That's how we're working, right, Chris? Yeah. Or what you would do is you can go to the encounter here, and then from the encounter, you would say, okay, the start time of this encounter was X, Y, Z, and the end time is whatever it is. You could change the end time right here. Okay. Say, well, it was actually until 8.30. Okay. Then you can write the reason. Is there a way to, let me see, is there another, I don't know, space you can write the reason or anything, or that would probably be in the actual note maybe, right? Yeah, it would be in the note itself, yeah. Okay. So you said something about a setup. So is that the way to do it or does something need to be set up? You said for the start and end time, at first you said there's something that needs to be set up. We didn't see it, but is that- Yeah. If you want to track it on the form, we would use a different form for this. If you are okay with just tracking in the encounter, then we can just leave it the way it is. But if you want start and end time on each of the forms, then we'd use a different form for that. Okay. Thank you. Jason, did you have a question? Yeah. Again, I guess just a comment that groups have to be 60 minutes. So it is important for us that if someone's only there for 50 minutes of the 60 minutes, we can't go for it. So we just need to know that there's got to be a way for us to track it. I think the way that you were speaking of having it on the actual group encounter would be really helpful for the therapist. If it's standard, everybody's there 8-9, and it automatically clicks 8-9, but then we can go in and easily just say, oh, this person left at 8.30. That would help us, A, not bill for a service that we can't bill for, but also just keep from, if they're leaving to go to a psychiatric appointment, which is what I see happening possibly, is they're just walking down the hall to see a psychiatrist for 15 minutes. We don't want to be in that double billing space. Right. But we can create these group templates, so to speak, Chris, by program two, right? Yeah, for sure. Okay. So I'll make a note, I guess, in this group chat about we want to actually on the encounter, which you said, set that up. I think that'll help. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Then we can use that time for billing. So if it is less than 60 minutes, we can create a rule that says, oh, if this is less than 60 minutes, then we don't want to bill for it or make it non-billable. The system will just do that for you. But Jason, Liz, Chris, so Karen, so is this, most of your group sessions that are going to be billable, you would really know because for the billable ones, you can't have billable clients and non-billable clients in the same sessions, right? Correct. Okay. So we'll know upfront, Chris, about the billable groups versus not. Maybe that's why we create the template and we make it easier on the staff. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. For the Psycho-Ed groups, like we were talking about earlier with FIS, that might not be billable because it's Psycho-Ed. But any therapy group, but it might be billed like we have Template A for Psycho-Ed, Template B for therapy groups, and Template B looks a little bit differently just so that we can make sure we're capturing things appropriately. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Chris, is there any other, this is just a form that we can create. You have other fields here that we can use? We're not sure about creating this template for a group? I mean, there's the program, the location, which programs are included for providing the services for this client, place of service, the provider, the assisting providers, the location of the group, the date, times, when it repeats, and then you can actually have the group notes be populated as well in the template. But everything else is individual to the group, like who's attending and the check-in of those and the notes against those. The fields on top are the only fields I can use in the group template? I think that's what I was asking. Yes. Okay. The start, begin, and end, you would have to do that for us or? No. When you create the template, you can say this group recurs on this basis in the template, or you can leave that out of the template, and then when you go to create the group, you would just create the group by saying, this is a group session, and this is the date and time of this, and it repeats every week or whatever the case is until a specific date. We also have the ability to allocate a room if you track the rooms that the groups are held in. But yeah, this is all the information that's in the template. But allocate room section, that's important to us because actually where the actual session gets held, is that something we type in? Yeah. We would create the rooms in the system, and then when you are actually looking at the calendar, you can say, I want to see a room-based view, and then that'll show you appointments in each room that you have set up. Okay. So we have to give you the room. So can we do it by location sometimes like a building? That's not, you don't get an address, you get a room. Yeah. When we create the rooms, we have to say which building it's located in, what floor, which room, and then we can select that. Okay. But we need to provide that to you approximately. Correct. Okay. So Jamila, we need to. Do you know that? Yeah. Yeah. You would either select the room, the physical room that it's in, or you can also say it's telehealth, and then it's assumed that it's virtual. Okay. So when you're setting up the groups initially, you can set up the groups. Is there any business rule around group sessions set up without clients? Or do they have to have clients? No. You can create the group sessions without clients attached. So they're just a placeholder on the calendar. Sure. Okay. Say virtual. When you go to save the group appointment though, it's going to ask you if you want to add clients, you would just say no at this point, no, and then just save it. Okay. Yeah. Do they will have like a dictation system that they can dictate the notes during the session or no? So we have that capability. I don't know if that's a. I think that was in the RFP. Because that's one of the things that the providers use a lot in behavioral health. I could be wrong. Jason, correct me if I'm wrong or Karen. But I heard that they do use dictation. You make a note of that, Neil, to look in. I mean, we need to make sure it's included in the contract. Yeah. It was a request in the contract, not for particularly this, but for sessions in general, or actually work in general, or providers be able to actually dictate notes. Yeah. We actually have a really robust dictation offering, and it also includes recognizing different voices in the group to document the notes for each of them. So it's really powerful. It's one of the, you know, we're one of a kind in that space right now. But I just don't know if that's been included or not. Okay. Okay. Good. And that dictation is different from a therapist that dictate their notes to then put in the system? What you're talking about, or it's the same functionality? Well, there is, I mean, we actually integrate with two different types of dictation. There's the straight, you know, dragon-type dictation, where you would just dictate, and it populates into the field you're speaking to. But we also have our AI-driven dictation, which allows you to document just by recording the session, and it automatically puts the notes where they belong for the people. And it can also, the AI component can also be included, which would summarize and apply clinical, you know, determinations or formulations in there as well, which is really slick. But, you know, there's some controversy around that, so. Yeah. Which, there was a provider that I met with that had that magic notes. Okay. Okay. So magic notes. So I'll be honest with you, knowing the RFP and what we asked for, it wouldn't have been that second thing. Yeah. It would have been the other. It would be a dragon, probably. So, yeah, but it will be nice to know if we, even from the sessions, that we can actually upload the notes. Yeah. Anything else on the program side that, any sticking points on the program side that you guys wanted to let us know? Not that we've already, not that we discussed or what we're tabling until later. Okay. If you can send me, again, just redact the client data, where you organize the information for the groups. I just want to see the type of data where we will put them. That's possible. I will send that. Thank you. Thank you. Anything else from our side? Neil, you think you have everything on your side for this? Yep. Okay. If they have any, I think, Karen, you sent already the reporting types for them as well, right, for FIS? The reporting. Sorry. The reports that you just sent? Yeah, the caseload report, which is what some of us use to track paperwork completion. So, like, the treatment plans, the OMS and symptoms checklist. Some of us also use the NextGen template, the program caseload summary, where you can identify cases and do reports. But I've found that I don't think it includes the OMS symptoms checklist. And I've had problems with the IAP, where sometimes it's not always clear whether it's in compliance or not. What I get on the caseload report seems different. But that's something that we can mention here to Chris, because if you are having issues with the symptoms that you are collecting, it's good for him to see what are the issues so that they can work on something that you guys can use. Do you want me to show you quickly the, I mean? Yeah, that would be great. I mean, this client in particular, you know, this template, BH, it has changed over the years. This is a client that's been in the system for a long time. Oh, sorry, I shouldn't have the information up here. Sorry, I just shared client information. I should have shared test client. Let me, hang on. You're fine. We didn't see it. Thank you, Aneesha. We have a BAA in place. Oh, I was going to say, Karen, that's the BACA OMS template? Yes. Okay. It now, I think, has a different, I'll share my screen. So it's now the, yeah, the HHS BH tool set. If you go here to the OMS, I think we went over this. We don't see what you're doing. Thanks. Okay, sure. Do you see now? Yes. I think Stephanie went over this. This is the OMS. This is the one that we created specifically to collect objective data about how clients are reporting symptoms over time. We collect this at intake at six months and every six months thereafter at discharge. And so then it's, but when we go to the, when you go to the program, I have to stop sharing my screen again. No, no, we are seeing it. Can you go back to the previous view? Because I can take a screenshot and post it here so that they can see the type of questions that you are. Can you see the program caseload summary here? Yes. So, you know, if you go into this, you can see the different providers. And if you go into, let me see if I have a test client here. So what this information shows is, you know, shows their caseload. But then if you click on the client, then it will, you can scroll down here and it tells you information like about the appointments, when they were last seen. It tells you their, the last review date. So this was when, you know, the last treatment review was, according to this, was May 15, 2025. But I found this is not always accurate. And there's, it shows here treatment plan review dates. So these are some additional ways that we can track. But there's no way to track the OMS, whether it's been completed or not, other than going into the chart and looking to see if it's present. Chris, this is Charisse from IT. This is yet another one of those forms that were internally created. It's not an extend form. And what I would suggest is that, what I would suggest is that a test patient be identified and the program staff put in the different templates that are particularly HHS. That way you all can see it. I think that would be better than a print screen. Because once you all get access, then you can go into that test patient record and see all the data. But that's just my recommendation I would throw out. I'm going to have to run. I've got another meeting, but let me know, just email me if you need anything else. No, I think this is good. Thank you so much for showing us. I think if we have other questions, we'll reach out. Keep sending us your reporting needs. Peace. We have a human task ahead of us to do that. So as it comes in your head, let us know. On our side, we're good. Chris, Neil, your side, everything? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thanks so much. Have a great day. Bye-bye. Thank you, everybody.",
