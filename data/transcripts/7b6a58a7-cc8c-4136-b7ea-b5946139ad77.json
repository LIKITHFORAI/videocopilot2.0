I mean, this is almost the open scratch. I think this is, yeah, just summarizing with the chargivity for knowledge. Okay, excellent. It can, if we implement that VLM, that VLM or OCR, OCR is also optical image recognization. Maybe the zoom recording, it will show the names like that. So, it can be. Cool. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that looks so advanced for me right now, but I will work towards that. My next thing is after the image recognition. No, I really wanted to ask you a few things. I have a requirement. I need a Microsoft graph API. How can I access with the office email? Yes, and also to access the SharePoint, I need a Microsoft API because right now it is everything is running locally. Everything, even the compression, everything is storing in my computer right now. So, if I do the SharePoint access, it just streams it without loading it. So, I need an access like API, one API key, if you can give me the Microsoft. And also, yeah, once we log in with the, so we need an authenticated to Microsoft authenticated. So, that is all need an API to work. So, yeah, I have not gone for all of them. That is another big topic for me. I need to study. No, I eventually have an idea of building our own LLM model with the data we have. So, what I really like today is that Open Dental, whatever this tool they have, the way of nodes they have, but do we have some manuals similar to them? Yeah, the manual. Yeah, they are so user friendly, I really like it. Yeah, and also it is more look like a old school. Yeah. Yeah. So, it is more look like a paint app. It is easy. Everything is icon visually. Everything has its own icon. So, it is in navigate. Probably, we should also try to work towards that. Yeah, you gave me that API. So, I need to work on that. But yeah, the thing I have not still gone into PHP is because I am going to finish this. Yeah. So, I realized how to start the PHP instead of just watching the videos. I want to take up as a project and learn the PHP. So, probably after this, I will work on the UI element you asked me to change. Then, yeah. Okay. If you are still around here, I will try to work on that image recognition.",
