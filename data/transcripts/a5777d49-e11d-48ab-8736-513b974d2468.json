  "text": "I appreciate you joining this morning and Happy New Year to everyone in the dental space. So I wanted to, I know we've had some conversation, we keep having conversation. There are other operations that are going on with your group in terms of the dental work and how it plays out on the other side with social services. So I want us to separate that from what this conversation is going to be today. This conversation is going to be specifically around the information that you're putting in next gen. So data for data. Right. So we're hoping that someone can actually walk us through the system as to where you put what and dental and specifically is a little different than anybody else we've talked to. So as detailed as you can get is very, very helpful to us. And if there's anything, you know, you can bring up the pain points of dental work as it relates to next gen, that's fine. But for this conversation, we're trying to get to the feel for feel information that you put into next gen. Kimisha, Trisha, who's going to walk us through the actual system this morning? I'll let Dr. Boyce make that decision. I have two OSCs on the call. I have Paola and Arlene. Can one of you all volunteer basically to show how from the time a patient calls for an appointment, what that process is in next gen? I also want to address the wait lists that we have outside the system. And then we can also go into so making the appointment when the appointment comes, the person comes in, checking them in and then bringing them back for treatment or care. That can probably switch off to, I guess, it can be me and Sige from that clinical standpoint. And then also addressing checking that patient out. Kim, can I have one of you all volunteer that? Paola volunteered already. So Paola's going to take the first part. Okay, so we definitely need you to log in and please address the wait list as a part of it. I keep bringing that up because you know, Dr. Nembhard, you've seen what our wait list looks like. I'm just on a spreadsheet. But do you, would you consider your wait list patients patients? Is that something you want to put into next gen? Yes, because sometimes there are patients that are trying to come back for, that we've seen already, their patients have recurred and they're trying to reschedule for their periodic exams. Okay. Okay. So they're, they're actually client with, with records. Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Good morning everyone. Add that to our list because the wait list conversation, the wait list functionality is not, not just for dental. So let's just add it to our list. Thank you. Paola, it is all yours. Paola, sorry. Hi, good morning everyone. Good morning. Yes. The data that we enter in next gen, when we basically, we schedule the appointments for our patients and in times it's already in the system. But there are times that we had to create their new profile. The information that basically collect is the demographic information that's already established by the County that requires that their full name, their date of birth and their address and phone numbers. That's, it's already listed on, on, on next gen as the demographic information. We, we entered that information in next gen. Paola, if you can share your screen to show us, would that be possible? Yeah. So what we're mostly interested in, cause we've been talking to a few groups already, anything different in the, in, in the demographics and the schedule that you would do. So normally I think all the stuff you're doing is kind of in the, in the, in the, I think all the stuff you're doing is kind of generic, right? So when you go in there, the same demographic. So is there anything specific in for dental that is collected? It's just the sliding, let this, the income information that's collected to determine how much they will pay. Do you put that in next gen? We put that in next gen. Yes. Okay. And the family size too? And the, and the family, yes, the income and the family size does enter it and, and the system and, and next gen. So can you, can you show us where, where do you put family size? Is there a household size field in the system? Yes, there is. Okay. Let me share my screen. Is it okay to use one of our patient's information? I mean, is it like. No, if you can do a test, if you could just search for a test and show us, that'd be fine. I don't know if she has access to testing. Yeah, I don't think I actually. There are test patients that are actually in next gen. So if you just go in and do test and test. Yeah. Piola for first and last name, you can use one of those. Yeah. And you will get access, Paula, to, to have actually access to the test environment. We already submitted that request. Thank you. But in the live, in the, in the production, you just use the test client. And then Paula, also make sure you talk about the Medicaid information that gets entered, please. The SkyGen information. Okay. And you're, you're, you're looking at a database and then putting that information into next gen? The SkyGen? Yes, we, yeah, it's, that's the insurance part. And, and that's where we entered the only thing, insurance information we collect is Medicaid. Okay. Okay. So this is what, can you see my screen? Yes. Yes, we can. So this is the, the data that is collected from the client, which is basic information, their last name, first name, address, phone numbers, social security number. If they don't have one, or they don't want to provide us with that information, we just enter a default number, which is all the nines. The insurance information is, is listed down here. We, we enter it by clicking new insurance. And then we select. Yeah. Okay. So by typing in part of the name of the insurance will populate the rest of the information. And once it shows on the list, we just double click on it, and it will select it as part of their insurance. And this is where we enter the, the ID number, the insurance ID number. So once it's entered, we click okay, and it will save it in, in the chart. I think this person already has one. Now, the part that is different. It's different from other programs is the, the sliding fee schedule verification, which is where we enter the family size and the income information. We had to select who is the guarantor or the head of the household of the person normally it is self, but if it's a minor, it will be one of the, of the adult parents. So we created by clicking new. And it will ask you to search for that person, and it will bring the person's profile. If the person isn't, it's not in the system, we had to create a person's profile. But in this case, it was selected for herself. And here's where you enter the family information, where you enter the income amount and the size of the family. Like, for example, I can say that there are two, and they have an income of $25,000 per year. And I just enter the date that I verify that information, which, which is today's date. The effective date is the same date, and the expiration date is based on their eligibility that's already been established when they apply for the program through OESS. So it can be. Now, this is the part where you enter only the income information. Up here is what will determine what their discount will be. It's going to ask you to indicate if the income that they have is greater or less than that amount for this physical year. Oh, so you don't enter the income. This is where you're saying you indicate the income, right? No, the pattern you indicate was the income that you collected from the patient or from when they qualify for the program. And that's what I indicated. And that's what I did down here. Okay, I see. And then you just select the range to get the sliding fee scale thing. I see. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So here's where you indicate if it's less or more than this amount. And we make it only effective until the end of the physical year, not based on when their eligibility expires. If it's later than the end of the physical year. If it's before June 30th, then we use that date. Dr. Boyce, this area is the one that you guys created yourself, right? It did not come with NextGen. I don't know if we per se created it. This was always here. We just started using it when we moved to the sliding fee scale. Okay, so it was part of NextGen already? Yes. The problem is it doesn't automatically pop. Well, because the two systems don't connect, we have to manually put all this part in, right? Right. And then also tell them today about the forms or things that you have built yourself after you completed the EDR training because they will need to know that so that they can integrate that in your system instead of you creating those forms again. Okay. I think we have the forms. Do we have the forms, Tricia? I think you don't. You may not have the ones associated with sliding fee. I'll give you all of our intake form packets and everything that the front desk uses. I'll just put everything together and just send it to you guys. Okay, perfect. And I'll put it in there. Thank you. And just a side note, Paula, did you finish the check-in process? Or you still have to show? No, it's just mainly the income part. That's the only thing different. That's what we change in the system for dental. And this is only to collect information or to update any information on the chart. But this is not the check-in process. Okay. But I think we know the check-in, unless you check in different than other programs. I think the check-in process for what I want, I don't know if Charisse or Selwyn is here. I just wanted to know if this came with through NextGen and if we have to modify this to be what it is, that sliding fee space there. The sliding fee scale, I've always seen it in NextGen. And there were other programs that use it before. Yeah, but I wanted to know if we modify to what it is or something that came with NextGen and they keep updating it themselves. There's a huge difference there and I'm trying to... It's okay. Don't worry about it. Keep going. Hi, Dr. Lampard. This is Arlene. Yes. The USD portal portion of this was there initially when NextGen started. It was fiscal's responsibility to have the annual update. Oh, so that this... Okay. The fiscal team, whenever they would receive the information from the state as to the poverty levels, they will be the one to update that information. And that's why we also update per fiscal year, whatever the changes are. Okay, perfect. Thank you, Arlene. And I'm sorry, I'm gathering some other people. There's some different other items that have to be addressed here. Did we go over the Medicaid, putting in the Medicaid paid information, Paola? Yes, I show it on the first part. Yeah. Okay. I just want to make sure that that's there. Okay. All right. All right, Paola. Keep going. So, do you need me to show you how... What you said you already... Yeah, we know the check. I mean, this is Neil and Dr. Cloud team. I don't think we need to go through the check-in, check-out. I think we need to know specifically what dental do after check-in, like how they do those pieces. Yeah. Do you also want to know... So, we also started doing just... There's another area that we use to collect data that's recent, that's changed for our East County program. We list the... It's a feature, and I'm going to list Debbie's. So, you're showing the USD... Because we have to... We wanted to make sure we're collecting the patient type and indicating who we are sending the patient to for co-management, because we have a lot of partners in the community. Okay. Do you guys want to see that? Yes. Yes, please. Yes. Okay. So, you have to share your screen, Debbie. So, I'm going to come off the mic, because we're all on the same... So, this is to accommodate the referral, right, Trish? Correct. And so that we know where they're going, in a way of tracking who they're with, do you track the service over on the other side? We're tracking it in... This is the problem. We're tracking it in a separate spreadsheet, because Next Gen EDR does not allow you to put in, like most dental softwares do, it doesn't allow you to say, this was done on the outside by an outside provider. So, we're tracking by procedure on separate spreadsheets, which is very time consuming. Yeah, we got to find a solution for that, because the other thing too, is a lot of it is also linked to contract and contract payment. So, yeah, I get what you mean. Let's talk through that, because I'm assuming Dr. Cloud probably don't have a solution for it either. But I think if we have Dentrix, because most traditional dental softwares, they do that for you. That's part of the system, but I know this was more like a dental add-on that's been created, but Dentrix may have that. Okay. All right. So, we'll explore that on that side then. No problem. The other thing too, though, and Diana, Jamila, let's add it to our list to talk to Dr. Cloud team. That's also part of our operations that we do. And I was wondering if there's anything in Dr. Cloud where we can track these. So, we are community partners. So, a lot of our work starts with the county, but are completed by vendors. Vendors we have contract with, but it's the same around sometimes the same clinical handoff, right? I just wanted to know if there's anything in Dr. Cloud where this can be documented in some way to be tracked, because right now there's a disconnect between us referring to our partners, our partners doing a service on our behalf, and then, you know, I'm tracking that service. So, not just for dental, just in general, that's the way we work. And I was wondering if there's anything in Dr. Cloud where that could happen. We don't have to answer now, just explore. Yeah, no, we have a referrals model. Okay. But it, I mean, it just allows you to track who you send the referral to. Right. You know, what it's for. And then, you can track the status of the referral. So, if you get feedback from it or response, you can track that as well. Okay. But do you, were you able to distinctly plug the activities of the service in? That's what we report on a lot. Yeah. The nice thing about our referrals module is it allows you to build a customized form for that. Okay. So, you can put anything in that form, including the services that you're providing. Okay. Okay. The service occurrence model. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I was also curious about the wait list. I mean, you've mentioned that, but what is it used for? What? I'm sorry, what? Me, me. The wait list. Oh, the wait list. So, in general, so, before Dr. Voice answer for their specific things, right, so, we have, in our practice, we always have more than we can serve. That's really what the wait list is for. And sometimes we get referrals, and we do intake, and we keep people on a wait list, because that's how we can prioritize our spending sometimes, right? So we don't want someone, because we can't serve them now, whether it's from a fiscal standpoint or a resource standpoint, they get, you know, they don't get intake at all, and then someone that comes in after them gets served. So there's a wait list practice in some of our programs. Not every program have that function, like they don't do it that way, but a lot of programs that are on clinical services kind of do it that way to make sure that our communities serve equitably, in a sense. Does that answer your question, Chris? Yeah. The other thing I'm wondering is, do you guys schedule appointments for folks on the wait list, or do they just sit on the wait list until you bring them in and then you're scheduling appointments for them? Tricia, how do you do that? So we do schedule, people who are on the wait list, we will call them and schedule them for appointments. So some people on the wait list are being brought in internally to our dental clinics for treatment. Some of them are being referred to our partners for treatment, kind of what Dr. Nembhard was talking about before. But it'd be nice to be able, we do have to track all that, and we're tracking that in many different kind of spaces, right? Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean, but would it be acceptable if you… Chris, do you have a system where the patient can receive an alert that appointment has become available, so that they can choose, let's say, if it's a same-day appointment? Because I know in the hospitals, we have that option where we can send an alert, or the system sends an alert to a patient that is on the waiting list, the next person on the list, per se, that something is available today in the afternoon. And the patient has the option to choose or decline, and it goes to the next person in line, waiting. We have that capability, but it's not integrated with the reminders right now. So, you could schedule the person, but you'd have to inform them that the appointment is available, or that they're waiting, you know, that it's available. Oh, so there's no way to push it to the customer? Not right now. That is actually something we're working on. I don't have a date when it's going to be done yet, but it is in the works, something like that. Okay. So, Diana, let's just put that down as one of our operational things that we need to work on, how it would, whatever is there now, how we can use it, right? Because we might have a part of a solution. I think that's what Chris is saying, right? So, we have pieces of a solution for those. So, here's the thing about the wait list, though. So, I explained it in a couple ways. So, there's wait list, not in an appointment space, right? We don't even have the resource to serve. There's that wait list. But there's wait list in terms of, I mean, resource in terms of funding, right? And then there's wait list in terms of appointment slots. I think I want to differentiate those two. That's what you were talking about, right, Diana? Like appointments, right? You don't have enough people to serve. Okay. All right. Correct. Because in the hospital, they have a different EHR, right? But in the EHR, they have set up a way that if a patient, because the hospitals have outpatient services, right, with specialties, and specialties appointments are very tight, just like dental. So, what they do is that it's, I am on the list, and all of you are on the list, but I am next on the list, and I will receive a notification saying that an appointment is available this afternoon or this morning. Do you want to accept it? And if I hit no, and I decline, it goes to the next person in line, which is Dr. Boyce, right? So, to offer that appointment to that person. But it's not, it wasn't us doing it manually. You know what I mean? It was like a waiting list attached to that reminder of appointments. So, that's the thing. No, okay. So, that's great. I think that's what Chris was trying to say, that they have a partial solution. But Chris, I want to mention that we do have that other waitlist scheme a lot more that I was telling you about, like, you know, to serve, right? They're not even waiting. Yes, okay. Thank you, Paola. You can keep going. Do you track that in NextGen, the waitlist stuff, or is that outside? We don't operate our waitlist in NextGen. At least the dental program does not. I have to check with other programs, Chris. It's checked it outside. It probably is. I think some might do it inside if there's an intake, right? So, we might have it both ways, right? Where I just get a referral. I haven't done an intake with a customer. So, that's outside, right? But you have others that there's an intake and I waitlist them. So, I have to check with other programs. But I think it's both that's happening right now, depending on if they intake the person. Okay. All right, Paola. So, I think here we were just going to show for our patients going for partners. Oh, the referral to the partners? Yes. Ah, okay. It's in the UDS. And if you go to classification, we have Care for Kids, East County, Montgomery Cares, Dorian White. So, these are patients that are being referred out. So, this patient is Dorian White. I'll go ahead and check off Dorian White. And then... And I'm... Hold on one second. And I'm assuming that classification beneficiary field is just a field we're using for this because that name doesn't really make any sense to what is being used. Yeah, it's a workaround. Okay. I just want to make sure that I'm not going crazy. It's a workaround. Okay. No, it's true. Okay. But I think when Chris explained that they have the referral module, if it's what I imagine, right, the referral module already have an area where we can build all the vendors that we use for referrals. And then, you know, like they will not have to use anything like this. Okay. Just want to make sure. Yes. Actually, Dentrix does that. So, you just enter in everyone that you're going to refer to and it will track it and do the data for it as well. And you can attach it to the patient so that it will remind you if you hadn't received it. Okay. Perfect. And just one more thing in reference to the waitlist functionality, Dentrix also has a waitlist functionality. You can schedule from that waitlist, but I believe that that is an add-on to be able to send a message to the patient to say you have available appointments. But Dentrix does have that capability. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, because I think that was created around like 2016 or 17, that availability in the EHRs. Okay. Thank you, guys. So, as you pointed out so eloquently, this was really a way of us to try and track the patients and collect the data. Okay. So, that's why we use that field. And then we also use a co-management, indicate the co-management to show where the patient is going. That's another field that we use. I'm just going to have my staff share that on here so you could see it. Oh, okay. So, we add the, if it's a co-managed patient, meaning that they're being referred to an outside partner, we add the partner in here so that we can also track that. And while we're on the topics, well, I don't know if this is an add-on, but, you know, patient surveys, I've been asking the IT team is something that we would really like to do to see how our patients are feeling about the care they're receiving, whether inside the county or outside with a partner. I know Dentrix has that capability, but I don't know if we, if the package we received has that. So, that would be something if you could look into. Yeah. So, in general, we're going to be working on that because we have to coordinate that through all the HHS. So, we're coming by our universal survey. We just need to know where to attach it to. And for now, from what the Dr. Cloud team says, we can actually do it through our patient portal. That's great. Thank you. So, we'll be able to do that. Okay. So, those are the only things I had to add here. I know, and then I don't know if you wanted to see what we actually do in EDR clinically. Yes. You do? Okay. Yes. While we're on the screen, I do want to say the school-based checkout for dental is slightly different. Do you want to see the regular checkout while we're here on the PM side? Do you want to see the regular checkout process and the school-based checkout right now? So, the school-based checkout, if it's different, we'd like to see it. We know what the regular checkout looks like. Okay. Okay. I'm going to have my staff go ahead and show the school-based checkout, some slight differences. So, good morning. So, at school-based health center, we have to add each insurance. So, we have three types of insurance. We use the dental care for kids or the care for kids students. Then we have... So, we have the dental care for kids or care for kids. Then we have Maryland Mighty Two, which is for students that have no coverage or no care for kids or Medicaid that might be private. And then the last one is SkyGen, which is the same that we use in clinic. Those are the three that we use in school-based that must be on the insurance side at check-in and then at checkout. Okay. Perfect. That's good to know. Okay. I think that's all. Paola and Arlene, is there anything that we need to show them as far as... Especially now we've moved to sliding fee scale with the checkout, is there anything that maybe we need to show them that's slightly different from what we did before? I guess, no, maybe so. Okay. I don't think there's much different than what was done before from the sliding fee scale. One of the concerns has been access to document management with the outside program. So, right now, if there's something in NextGen, it does not interface with anything else. So, you would either have to snip it or make a copy and then place it somewhere else if you want a document in more than one place. So, how would sharing documents be? Can you provide an example of that, what you're talking about? Okay. So, when we're in a patient's chart, if we're scanning their information into the document management and we would happen to need that same document just to almost attach it to an email, we cannot do that directly from NextGen. So, we would either have to make a copy of that document, print it, and scan it again so that we have it available then to attach to anything else. So, everything that is in document management, it's only functional in NextGen. We would have to download or print or copy if we want that document for use of anything else. Yeah, and that's typically due to HIPAA. I mean, there's concerns around sharing documents out of the EHR. So, most EHRs will have some sort of a firewall to prevent you from just emailing whatever out of the system to whatever email address. But you can do that pretty easily in DrCloud by either downloading the document and then sending it, or you can print it to a PDF and then send it, or we offer integrated faxing. So, you could fax directly the document, the system. You can make it where they just flag. Is there a free demo system to show how to interchange? Will that be something that it will be able to be part of a patient portal, Kamisha, and Dentrix, like those type of forms? I'm sorry, can you re-ask the question? Yeah, so what Arlene was mentioning about these forms, that they are only in NextGen available and not in, and if she wants to send it out, she has to scan it, print it out, scan it, and send it out in a different way. When you say send it out, who will be the people receiving, including the patient? Because that might help, because you know how when you have the patient portal, the patient can print their own documents and send it to whatever they need to. So, and Dentrix, Dentrix doesn't keep you from uploading, downloading, or printing unless you put those provisions. Unlike NextGen, where it's like we're in a bubble when we're in NextGen, in Dentrix, we're not in a bubble. So, hypothetically speaking, any document that we're going to upload, we're scanning it into Dentrix. If we want to go print it out, we hit print and print it right out of Dentrix. So, I don't think that that will be an issue anymore. In addition, with Dentrix, you can tailor your document center to what you want it to be, even if it's just on the fly. If you want to name the document something else, and then in Dentrix, it's already pre-populated for in-house referrals, out-house referrals, and again, you can customize that functionality. So, I think that solves the NextGen issue with documents. Yeah, because I think they also have a functionality where they have like a message services between Dentrix and the patient, right? Yes, but that is actually another add-on service. But yes, all of those things. Dentrix says the dental software that they have, is that what Dr. Carlton used or not? We have something in the RFP about open dental and dental packs, but I don't recall Dentrix being mentioned. Yeah, so it's one of those, I think it's one of those packs that we're talking about. That was one example of one of those packs. Okay. Okay, never mind. Never mind, we're dreaming here. So, can I get, do we, is this a place to come from? Because I was told we had Dentrix. Do we not have Dentrix? Is Dentrix not what's coming with Dr. Cloud? What dental software is coming? I thought it was Dentrix. That's what I think was informed to me by IT. Let me get you back that answer. I'm trying to figure out how all of this are working together. Does the dental packs, is that used in this scenario? I believe that's the radiology portion. How is radiology done in the softwares that you guys use now? So, right now, it's in a standalone system outside of the actual EDR. It used to be that we could access it in NextGen, but when we moved to the cloud, that we were, that was put into another system. So, you have to log in to a different system, Aptrix is what we have to log into. Aptrix? Yes, right now, to see a patient's x-rays, and you have to use, instead of using their MRN number, you've got to use their person number. The logins are never the same for the user. They change at different times, so that can be cumbersome to see the x-rays, but the x-rays are not being housed in the actual patient chart in NextGen anymore. So, it used to be there, it's not there anymore? Yeah. But it means it's there, so some files have it, some files don't. That's really what it is. Right, some files will have it before we moved. Remember when NextGen moved to the cloud? So, if the patient has a record from that point, you know, from before we moved to the cloud, there's x-rays somewhere in there, but I believe that capture section was deactivated for us, like to look in NextGen to even access that, but it's somewhere, I'm sure it's saved somewhere in that file for some people, so it's still in there, those x-rays are still in there, but then everything got moved to Aptrix outside in the standalone. Sorry, Neil, go ahead. I was going to ask, so can you give us just a little more information about how the workflow works with Dentrix and NextGen? Well, we don't have Dentrix right now. Okay. We're using solely NextGen. Okay. And Aptrix for the radiology, so I think Dentrix is an example of something, which is like a packet that would be added onto DrCloud, I think. I need to get to the bottom of this piece, Neil, sorry. Dentrix got on the earwaves to a few folks, so I need to get some information around that and figure out what that is, but there's supposed to be a packet that comes with DrCloud that's supposed to have these types of features, I think. The features is what they're more talking about than anything else, but I have to look at how the RFP was done. I don't remember, honestly, but I need to figure that out. Okay. So, okay. So, the, since the Aptrix piece is separate, right, now, guessing those files aren't going to come over. So that's a big deal because that's the current images, you know. So let's, Neil, Ryan, let's park that and see what that is, like, because right now the actual radiology piece is not NXIVM, but it is a part of the whole file. So I need to figure that piece out. That's going to be a little wacky. Sounds good. Yeah. But whatever, I think what we need to do... Let's take all of this from what Dental is saying. I know Dental was going to be a little different, and then let's talk with your team about what we understood from the RFP to ask for Dental, okay? Because I want to stay within that space, and then I need to figure out the rest of that, right? Because I don't know if it's a package that will give us the functionality we need, or it should be in DrCloud itself. You get me? So I'm trying to figure that out. Okay, so are... Is this the correct... So you wanted to see what we do in the actual EDR, right? Yes. Okay. Is this the test patient we need to bring out for you? Let me just bring up... It should be the same one. Is it the same one? The MRN? Is it the same one? The MRN ending in 904? No, this is a different MRN. So you can go on your schedule, if that helps you. Okay. Sorry, I'm just bringing the test patient up, and I have a Dental Assistant here, so she can... I'm going to share my screen so she can kind of walk you through what we go through. So can you basically say... So we... Let's chart... Let's see what has already been on here. So let's say we're doing... We did a periodic exam today. Just put that... You're going to put that in there, right? So periodic exam. Go to exam. Periodic. And the way I do it is because sometimes if I go here, it kind of gets out. So I just press okay, and then it comes here to plan. Blockchain. Anything else? Yeah. So let's say we're planning for a filling on number four. Composite. Oh, I'll... Okay. So now I want you to print out a treatment plan for this patient that they need to sign. Okay. So I'm going to go to plan. I'm going to click the both of them. Right click. Go to group for today's visit. It's one. I like to recalculate just to make sure. And then... Okay. So... Oh, there was already... There was a previous treatment plan there, which is good because this is a problem. So that's good. So can you just show... Like say you go to print the treatment plan for the patient to sign. Can you show them and bring that up? Like what that looks like? Okay. Should I... Do you want me to take everything? Yeah, I should, right? Yeah. So this is an issue we've been having here and I don't know if this will be solved with whatever dental software we're having. But if there were items that were treatment planned from before, they have to now... I think you have to go and put today's date on, right? Yeah. Well, since this was done today... Well, since there was already a visit one, I'll just delete everything else. You'll delete everything else? But suppose I wanted to add something from before in addition to today, how would you do that? So say you wanted to add the amalgam. So I'll just... Before I delete it, so I make sure. That's funny. Yeah, just do... Okay. I'll just go to amalgam. I'll go to occlusal. Okay. 20. That will be up here. I'll just have to add it back to group one and then... Oh, you have to add it back. Yeah. And then I'll do... With today's date. Yeah. And then you have to delete it. The other one. Yeah. So then I'll just delete it like that. Okay. Now, can you show the treatment plan that you're going to have a patient signed for today? I'll click these three. Well, in that case, I would probably want to move these three. Out of dental visit one. Yeah. But go ahead. Just go ahead. Just to make sure. I'll just change them to group two. Okay. Can you scroll down? Oh, he wants to see the different visits. Can you scroll down? Yeah. So dental visit one, dental visit two, those are all previous visits. Well, these are their plans. They're planned visits. So sometimes the providers break down the visits into what... This is what you would have on visit one, visit two. And it can actually... It will print out, separate it out like that on the treatment planning sheet for the patient to sign. And we like to do that so the patients know what they're paying for that same day's visit and for the next visit. So, can you show me? Yeah. And then I'll just press create treatment plan document. This is selected, the group. Let's do Rockville. And then okay. If everything looks fine here, then I'll just go ahead and print it. Well, can you just expand? So come out there. Don't print it yet. So expand it so they can see it. And so we do print it and then have the patient manually sign. Be nice if this could be all electronic. Just saying. And then as you can see, the sliding fee that based on the income and family size that was entered in the check-in process is calculated here. And it's showing the patient only show their flat fee patient of $5. And this is a proposed treatment plan that a patient will sign. And then we will then, once the patient signs it, it gets scanned back into the chart. That's why I'm saying it'd be nice if this was all electronic because you're printing and having patients sign and then having to scan it back in. And yeah. But it's good that we have these on record because we've had a lot of times where patients are arguing, well, I did not know. This is not what was told to me. And then once we have these scanned and signed, especially when they're signed and documented, it becomes part of their records and nobody can ask you. Okay. So that's good. Did you? Oh, some of the other functionalities. That we have. So for instance, can you show them when you are scanning in a referral? Like if you have, so for instance, the patient may be referred to an outside vendor or provider, or there's a lab prescription that has been filled out. These items are scanned by the clinical dental assistants into the chart. And I'm just going to let her show you where those are. New document. And then I'll choose whichever one. So I'll just do oral surgery referral, which is in-house and then use scanning device. Okay. I think it will be good if you can go through the entire steps and then produce a test bill, because we're in a test patient, right? A test bill for them to see how hard it is for you guys, because you have to even select. Nothing is getting on the screen. So you have to select a test bill for them to see how hard it is for you guys, because you have to even select. Nothing is getting out of populated. They are doing everything manually in this program. Okay. This program is actually part of NextGen? Yes. It's an add-on, you said, right? It was an add-on. It's something that they have to, the staff who was here in 2017 really had to build out, because NextGen did not have a dental software. Can you also show them? So let's show them like period hurting, if you're period hurting on a patient. Let's show them that. So I'll just go back to the chart. I'll press perio, and then I'll do a new perio exam. And say, I'm just calling the numbers 3, 2, 3, 5, 7, 4. So that's periodontal turning, just so you see that's another feature that we use. Let's come out of this. I'm not going to say changes. What else are you doing? I think that's pretty much it. Yeah. We were trying to do Cary's risk assessments in here. But we were having some issues with that, with the way the program was set up. We weren't able to tailor it to patients, so we just didn't even use it. The Cary's risk assessment feature that they have here, it just was not working. I'm trying to think if there's anything else. I think that's pretty much about it as far as what we're doing here. But once again, let me just show them. If we were trying to show, ideally what you would want to see in a dental software is that say we had referred this crown out, right? It says right now it's showing that this crown is needed. But say we referred it out to a partner, like University of Maryland, and they completed it. The only thing that we can do is chart and say it's completed, and it looks like it's completed here. It's not showing that it's been completed. You don't have the ability like you have in a traditional dental software to show that it's been completed on the outside by an outside provider, because that's important information, that this was not done here. You could say it's existing, but that doesn't give you the whole picture, that it was done somewhere else by maybe a specialist that we referred to. That's common in dental, like the molar endos, right? A lot of molar endos are done by specialists, and then the specialist is sending it back to you to go ahead and complete the restoration. But you want to chart where that molar endo was referred out to and where it was completed on the outside. When we put completed in here, it's looking like we completed it ourselves. Is that what that completed button is? Yeah, it'll show, or it'll just say it's existing. It's not giving, are you talking about this button right here? Yeah, there's also one below that says completed by approval, right above emergency. It's in that same box area that you were in. Do you see where he's talking about? Go to the third row and then down most of the way. Go to the third row. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you were here. Oh, this is a treatment complete. This means that everything that was needed for the patient or all the treatment that was completed, that that's been done. The reason why we put this here is that it's part of our data collection as far as our performance, because we want to be able to track when a provider has completed a case. And so, in dental, there's a lot of dummy codes, tracking codes that are created, and so that was a dummy code. But that's not necessarily to show that a service is complete, would have you go through the process. I'm going to let you show again that where that gets tracked. So, for instance, I could do what we planned for today's visit. Yeah, go ahead and show that. This is the process. Oh, you have to choose a diagnosis. Oh, yeah. Nowadays, we got to choose a diagnosis and then complete. And then this is right. These are the notes that are auto populated. You can also do manual notes. And this is the whole note taking process just to get to a completed item. And then now on the notes, it shows as completed. Right here, it says complete. Say that again. I'm sorry, you're blanking. What about signatures? Are there any kind of electronic or cosine options or anything like that that you use? We don't have that. That would be nice if we could do electronic signatures so that the document is being uploaded instead of us manually having to have the patient sign and then us having to scan the paperwork back in. You're talking about like lab orders. What about medication orders? How does that work? So, charting medication. When they're going to prescribe something out of the clinic, they'll choose Rx. And then they either will do completed because that's what they did today. And you have to choose a code again. Right. And then they'll choose whatever they want. And then they'll do all of this again, all the notes that come with it. And then, yeah, same thing. Is it getting to the med profile in the other parts of NextGen? Yes, it does. You can also link to, there's a medication module where they can update. It's the same thing in the NextGen, the medical side. We're all using the same prescription module. So, this probably works with the prescribed too, right? Does it send to the pharmacy? Yes, it does. It's the same thing. So, I'm sure you've already seen that. I don't have to. I don't think we've seen prescribing yet, but I think it's coming up in one of the meetings. Yeah, that's where they can put all their medications. Yes, they can put their medications. Okay. And we can see the shared medications. We can, here it is right here. So, allergies, diagnosis, that kind of stuff is all shared? I don't know if it's all shared. At least the medications, we can see what the other people, what everybody can see what the patient, what medications the patient's on. Okay, cool. Yeah. I just want to see how that interaction. Yeah, I'm good. Okay. So, you're good here? All right. Patient is already running. Let me go back. Okay. I think that is it on this side. Yeah. I don't know enough about a buildout on sliding scale. Chris, is there anything we need information specifically about how the sliding scale is built out? Well, we just need the percentages and the actual breakout of the scales. Yeah. So, there's an actual functional spreadsheet we can share the sliding fee scale functionalities across the programs. Again, not just dental. I think it came up in other programs too. So, that's something that we'll provide to you of what we're- I didn't recall seeing a place for that in the requirements document. So, I wanted to make sure that we got it somehow. Oh, okay. It probably wasn't something specific. I'll have to look at the requirements document. Yeah. I mean, I get a lot of cleanup on the requirements document. So, I'm pretty familiar with what's in everything. I don't think we asked specifically about that. So, I'll probably- Okay. So, yeah, that's one of those things that we're going to really have to add. It's just one of those. The thing about the sliding fee scale though, and the reason why I don't want to kind of talk about it one-off with a program, that's why I've been quiet. There's sometimes a handoff functionality from the social side for it, right? So, I have to kind of figure out how those work and that's why we kind of need EICM interoperability, right? Because sometimes that fee is calculated on the social side because the intake is on the social side. So, sometimes the intake is on the clinical side and we use the same scale, but sometimes it's on the social side and there's a handoff to clinical. You get me? So, both systems talk or the social sides have the demographics that's needed for the scale. So, I have to- I haven't talked about it yet because there's some functionality that needs to happen, not just having the scale in the system. You get me? But we should have some space to talk about that and I can share with you the spreadsheet for the sliding fee scale, what it looks like. I can share that. I'll share that today. In the comments, Jamila asked what version of Dentrix are you using? They're not using Dentrix right now. Right. And it was just like an idea software that's an ideal software that we're thinking through, but they're not using Dentrix right now. I think what we're more interested in is the solution for dental from Dr. Cloud, right? So, what packet comes with that? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. We're probably almost at time. Anything else? Any other questions that you guys want to share? I think there's nothing else from Dr. Cloud. Nope. So, thank you. Thank you guys so much for sharing this information with us. Tricia, if you can send me your packet, I can share it with the Dr. Cloud team. Okay. Okay. Will do. Thank you. Thank you guys. Dr. Boyce, if you can send us all the reports that you guys need every month, or the frequency, every month, every three months, every six months, whenever that's needed. And also mention there about the, not just the sliding fee, but put a comment there so that we can also remember about the, is that the cash collection or something that Arlene is doing right now, that is manual work? The fee collection reports? The fee collection. Remember that you have to like review if everything was fine and put some wording on there, because that's, that's not, that's not going to work. And I already pulled the email that you sent me, so I'm going to try to look into that. Yes. All right. Thank you guys. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you.  Bye. Bye. Bye.  Bye. Bye. Bye.  Bye. Bye.  Bye. Bye. Bye.  Bye. Bye. Bye.  Bye. Bye. Bye.  Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.  Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
