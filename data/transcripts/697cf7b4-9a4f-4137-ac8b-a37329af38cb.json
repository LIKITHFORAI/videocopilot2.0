I did put the recordings in their own separate folder, but I can make a folder for the AI notes. I know that we had some previously. I'll have to go back and collect all of those and move those to the SharePoint. But yeah, I can make a folder. You can make, I mean, you have access, you can make a folder as well if you want to move them there. Yeah, helps with remembering tasks. Absolutely. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Summer. Good morning, all. Good morning, Anisha. Good morning. Good morning. How's everyone doing today? Good. Ready, ready. Yes, yes, yes. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy New Year and happy birthday to me. Oh, happy birthday. That's wonderful. It was my birthday yesterday, by the way. I'm getting older. That's all. That's all. That's a blessing, though. Thank you. Oh, my God. We have two meetings going on at the same time every day, morning and afternoon, and they are simultaneously. We're waiting for Karen to join us. She said she was joining us. I forwarded her the invite, so hopefully she got it. Yeah, she'll be here probably in a minute, not 9 a.m., a small minute. Good morning, Sharice. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Sharice. Stephanie Kelly, Anisha, or Karen will get the whole thing. Karen can do the whole thing. I told her she could bring whoever she wanted to, though. We probably could have did all of them together. Good morning, Karen. Morning, Karen. We can't hear you. Good morning. Sorry. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Dr. Johns, are we good? Somebody's representing us in the other meeting? Good morning, Diane. I'm toggling between the two. Since Sharice is over here, I think I'm trying to toggle back and forth. Yeah. Hi, good morning. Who's holding out coal fire? I just sent a message to Jamila to see if she came. Yeah, I could go to coal fire. Okay. Yep. Okay. Bye-bye, everybody. Thank you. Meetings after meetings, right? Yeah. We're going through a HIPAA audit right now, so all the same people are in all the same meetings across the board. So thank you guys for your patience. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. I think this is our team, right? Yes. Good morning. All right. I think this is it. I think we can get started. Good morning, everyone. Summer, you want to give the spiel about the recording first? Thank you all. These meetings are recorded. So if you guys have any objections to that, please let Dr. Nambar know. And I'm not sure how we'll move forward with that. However, just to give you all the spiel that these are recorded and transcribed to be able to track what needs to be done on a later basis. This information is kept out on the county SharePoint. Thank you. I'm OK with the recording. And if anybody is not OK with this, just let me know. So I'm glad everybody is able to make it. This morning is going to be an interesting morning. I think this is the first of Bureau of Health so far. Hold on. Oh, this was the one Tamar wasn't in. Give me one second. I'm just going to call Tamar real quick. So today, what we want to do, I know we spoke before on the your work that you kind of doing next gen and the business process for that. But specifically, this meeting is into the actual details of field to field. What what do you put into next gen? So what we're hoping this morning is that someone will walk us through the actual screens of where you put your data. What type of data you put in? Is there any business rules around how you put in your data and all the different spaces in next gen that you use? So this is not necessarily for your future process, but what is it that you're actually doing today? And the reason why we're doing that is we want to make sure that we capture all the data that you need for moving forward. So we have to transfer all the data that's in next gen appropriately to Dr. Cloud. And to do that, we need to know specifically what you're putting in. OK, we probably won't get into wish lists, but it might be we can still talk about that. And I think Dr. Cloud will show us some screens, like some demo that's related. If we have some time to the type of work that you're doing. But is anyone who's going to take the. The helm on your side, let me see. Karen is going to walk us through. Yeah. OK, perfect. I can start and Stephanie can fill in. Stephanie is here also. So you guys can start. If you can tell us how you get your clients to like, is it a referral from outside? Like, how do you get your client? Yes. So we have a Excel referral form that is filled out by oftentimes by schools, counselors. Our admin will fill it out. We add it to a spreadsheet, which is our referral log. And we have met with. We have met to talk about the because the wait list and referral process is a is a is a big issue. But I'm understanding that that's part of the wish list. So I won't go into a whole lot of detail about that. But, you know, currently we have an Excel file that is our referral log and wait list. So as cases, as referrals come in, they're added to that Excel spreadsheet. We prioritize them based on acuity. So some might have prioritized wait list. And and as we assign them, we mark them off assigned. We have a spreadsheet for Rockville, for Silver Spring. And there's a separate one for community based, which is a little bit. Different, but the same concept. So they get a lot of their referrals from child welfare. And but if you have specific questions about community based, let me know. But I'll speak mostly about the clinics. Well, once again, so for the Dr. Cloud team. So to to to kind of give a framework about the referral that comes to this particular program in behavioral health is a coordination of a lot of external vendors. And because they're not in our system, that makes it very, very difficult to coordinate. Right. So we have schools. We've got some internal folks, but we also have providers in the community. There's not a solution for external vendors to send information to HHS. Right. There's a there's a partial solution right now that's in the works. Right. That will have to work out. But when when the programs talk about that difficulty, that's the space they're talking from. Is that we don't have a vendor referral, secure vendor referral process or tool in the county that can interface with us in the community at this time. And I can I can kind of give you a spiel on what a potential solution is like, which will be probably a coordination between the Dr. Cloud team and other tools that we have. So I just want to kind of level set that. And that's for most programs. Right. So that's what you hear about that intake spreadsheet. It's because we don't have a way of getting the information in any kind of system. Karen, so if you can walk us through NextGen, when you when you when you've coordinated all of this and you're putting someone in the system, how what does that look like? So so the whole referral and assignment process is before a client is entered into the system, into NextGen. So once we have a scheduled intake appointment with the client, they come in, they complete our paperwork and well, and then a chart is a chart is created for them and they are put on the appointment schedule. And then the paperwork is scanned into the chart, the consent forms, the releases of information and that kind of thing. But the chart is created once the intake appointment is scheduled. Do you mind showing us in NextGen how you do this? So our admin does it in practice management. They I don't know how to create. Karen, I can. Yeah. Great. Thank you. I'm not logged into NextGen yet. I am. And I can create a chart real quick. Hold on. Let me share my screen. Can you guys see? Yes. Yeah. OK, so this is practice management. This is where like a client is created, although if I show you how to create a client, I'm creating a client in NextGen, which I'm not supposed to do. Can you use the test one? You want me to create a test subject? Or I mean, so I just need someone IT to say, yes, do that. Because that's not something I'm allowed to do. OK. Yes. Well, you can create a there's existing test records. Right. You won't see the steps of creation in an already created chart, though, which is what you're asking to see the steps. So I would have to create a new one. OK. Oh, boy. Now I hope I can remember how after all that. OK, so new person. One second, Kelly. Can she create a test? Yeah, we've seen this before. So is there anything to the demographics? Then this is OK. Right. Yeah, no, this is OK. We've seen the creation process. I think if there's anything unique with the fields that you use that we just need to be mindful of, we'd want to call that out. But if this is kind of typical of the news, new client creation record process, then we've seen it. The only thing that maybe I don't know if it's different and let me see if I can find it. Somewhere in here, I don't know if maybe it pops up, but there's a field called guarantor. And perhaps the only thing that might be different is because our clients are minors. We include parent information as the guarantor. So I don't know that that's different. But that's the only thing I could think of field wise that might differ. OK. Yeah, that's available in other fields as well. The school based health does the same thing as well because they see child patients. Very good. Cool. Should be the same then. Do you want to see an appointment go in? I think we saw that yesterday, too. So we're getting more familiar with the scheduler now. And like we said, there's some tests. If you search on test, if you want to take one of the test patients through the workflow as close to end to end as you can, that that would suffice. Sure. So we can move out of scheduling then and you want to just go into the documents. What are they called? When you schedule things, just start pardon the interjections. When you schedule things, is there anything that is billable versus non billable in the scheduling process? No, they're all. Well, no, that's not true because we currently at times schedule things in PM that go into a category. It's essentially like employee activity tracking where if they are in a meeting or something that let me just I'm going to babble, but I'm just going to show you. Oh, yeah, please. Thanks. As we noted that yesterday, some of the calls. So let's just say we have an employee that's doing like attending like a child's meeting at the school. It's not a clinical service, so it's not going to get billed. So it would go under unavailable business. Same for like staff meetings, supervision times. This like data goes into like what they're doing in their day. And so it would go under unavailable business. Choose a location. Choose a person. And the only difference is it doesn't get checked in. Did you see the check in process? I did. Yeah. OK, so we don't check in. Unavailable personal is also used for like personal leave lunch, things that they're not actually working. And so essentially it's the same thing. You just create this appointment all the way through. But then they don't get checked in because it doesn't trigger. It doesn't connect them to the E.H.R. And you don't actually even have to connect this to a client. You could just. Do this and it's just there. You put notes in about what they're doing, but it doesn't actually connect to a client necessarily. And then we don't check it in. It doesn't connect to the E.H.R. It doesn't generate any billing for the billing people. Stephanie, the reason why you guys do that is because we don't have a case management module. Oh, what was the reason that you have to put the notes in this area where the schedule is? We have historically been asked to track like employee activities that are not trackable through like billing. So, you know, essentially, yes. Having some kind of like accounting for their time. So that's what that's for. Yeah. So it's a workaround, Ryan, that they are using because the same issue that we are having, every time they link something to an actual patient, the system actually sends a bill to the patient or the patient's insurance. Even if the service is non-billable, it's just a simple note that the therapist is doing. OK. Yeah. Neil and Chris and Balakrishnan, let's think about these scenarios. Right. I think the appointment types, we need to just review them, make sure that we're asking for that information in the right way and which ones are billable versus non-billable. We can stage all that in the system and demonstrate it. We already have that. We do it when we create an account. You know, we have the option to mark it as billable or non-billable. We already support that. So Neil and Chris, let's go through the spreadsheet and make sure that we're asking for that information in the proper way. Yeah. And I guess the most important part is they do want to be able to run reports. So even if the system is, once they do notes, they are not able to run reports if we don't have that workaround. To see, you know, the time that they spend or the many notes that they gather, you know, during that day. So reporting is an issue as well, that they don't they don't have a way to do that. OK. Yeah. Yeah. So I just want to elevate this to more of an organizational ask. Right. So I think the business problem right now is that we need a space for you guys know the charitable ratio hours. Right. So the work that is done and it's not a schedule because sometimes it's not a schedule because vacation is not a schedule. It's literally the management workspace of worker time. And the reason why it needs to be that meticulous is that in our government space, we have to account for some of these things that are out of clinical time. Right. And we need the same system to do the same thing. We don't want to be able to do that in Outlook because it's not it needs to be carved around the actual clinical work. Right. So that's the reason. So the ask right now, Ryan, is a larger business ask of how to manage non billable time. Yes. Understood. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Any more questions for the scheduling and P.M. I think the other issue that I have noticed that they might need support is when they have a Stephanie in caring. I might need your help to remember this, but they have the therapies, but they also have, let's say, somebody else with a different license. I'm trying to locate the name. It has a name in the access request form. Clinical assistant, the clinical assistance. So when they have a clinical assistant under a therapist license in the clinical assistant updates things in their schedule. I think Karen was having some issues and also Claudia, where they were not able to follow through the updates that that clinical assistant was doing with the patient. So, for example, let's say Karen, Chris, so me today, I was the patient and she was the clinical assistant. Right. Under Stephanie. Right. And then Stephanie see me like next week. Stephanie will not be able to see the medications that Karen updated under me or the notes. They were having issues with that and we didn't know why. That should be a that should I mean, they should be able to see the notes and medication that I think is just a configuration issue of like their view. We have that happen sometimes and often it's just a matter of clicking a button. But the the licensure issue that you're talking about is is, for example, when we have a social work student who doesn't have a license, they go under a licensed clinician and need a P.A.Q. Who so that that licensed clinician can sign off on their notes. So the note should show up under their name that they saw the client, but then the licensed clinician is signing off on the form. And similarly to LMSW, so social workers who have a master's but not yet a clinical license, they also need to have a clinician sign off on their notes and treatment plans. So they need P.A.Q. And more than the ability to sign off, there needs to be like a delivery system. The like. top clinician can't, like, go looking for that stuff, there currently is a system that is set up, which is the PAQ that Karen's referencing, that delivers all of those documents, and that is essential because otherwise the signing clinician can't just wade through the EHR to find every document. So the getting them to the right person and connecting everything is important for that. Okay. That makes sense. What is the PAQ? Provider. Providing encounters. Provider approval Q. Provider approval Q. Yeah, so when we go up and when we set up. I can show you it if you want to see it. So I'm behind. Arnesha, don't look. I blame the holidays in the overwhelming amount of notes. So I supervise, I'm a clinician, and I supervise one of those people that Karen was talking about. So these are all her notes. And so this is the system that automatically delivers them to me. So I can go in and look and read it and review. It's signed and generated by her. Actually, actually sign it. Okay. And then I just click sign off and it applies my signature at somewhere. I saw it. Whatever. It's in there somewhere. Oh, no, it didn't. Oh, it's just getting ready. It went on to the next one. It disappears. Yeah. Yeah. So then it applies my signature. Also, it's called a counter signature to get the right level of clinician on it. And so this is the system that it just delivers it to me. So it's kind of in my inbox here. And clearly, I'll be working on that today. And we have this is that it, you know, it enables the supervisor to go in and just see the notes right, right away and goes directly to the information that's being inputted and sign off on it without interrupting the billing or the other processes. So the yeah, you don't have to like, yeah, yeah. And I see what's happening. I've asked Chris to get into our demo system. So when we're done with next gen, we'll kind of show you how supervisor signatures and what the queue looks like in Dr. Cloud. After this. And no concerns. We have all this functionality. So, yes. So then once the client is scheduled and checked in for their intake, we the we have a template that's called intake. No medical services that has our has all of the templates that we need for the comprehensive assessment. The therapist meets with the client and completes the comprehensive assessment in the first one to two sessions. Sorry, I realize I need to make an appointment to show you that just what I'm doing right now. And the documents are scanned in to their church. Rachel has a question right now. Yes. You can ask. This is like second nature. Go ahead. My ears are still working. So I'm very interested in this assessment completion. Is there is there is there a dashboard to see the client and the how far you are with each assessment per client? Like, is there a dashboard for that? No. OK, so that's one of the management things that we want to talk through with the doctor. Not in this session. I just want to put that on the list. Yeah, I definitely would like to talk about that because the ability to manage a case is slim with what we have. And I have some thoughts and feedback about what how it currently is in here and what would actually be functional and questions about that specifically. I can I'm happy to show you. Maybe you said in another meeting there is a section in here that has the slim ability to view what's there. So happy to do that. But for today, I can show you this. Do me a favor. Right. So in the interest of time, if you can send me those notes in an email. About your case, managing your case, what you'd like to see, because I'm gathering this for all for everybody. Right. So what is important to you to manage your case in your in your supervisor review and for your staff, what would be what's important to them? OK. Could you repeat that? I apologize, Richard, that what's important to the staff about managing their cases, managing their work? Yeah, just anything. Right. So and then I want it also from your perspective as a supervisor managing them. What would you like to see? We have a spreadsheet where we keep those, but it's it's problematic. And so having a dashboard would be similar, but we could send you a template of the spreadsheet that would show you, you know, the treatment plan is done, signed. When is it due? When the symptoms checklist was done, when it's due. Not everyone. I mean, my team uses that, but they don't update it regularly. And there's also functions in NextGen, though, for some of that. And that's what I was going to reflect on is like what's already there, the program caseload summary. Right. So if you guys can put this in, just even if you write it in the same spreadsheet and send it to me. Right. That'd be great. And then I can give it to the doctor because I also need to put this together for everybody else that's viewing this thing. We have a staff dashboard as well. So when Chris shares some screens, he'll pull that up and demonstrate that. So you might get some of the functionality. Yes, certainly from what I'm hearing. Keep going, Stephanie. Sorry. Thank you. That's OK. I just want to I don't want to go too fast for people writing. So I'm showing right now an intake, like a initial assessment first appointment. So we. Oh, OK. Sorry, guys, I'm a supervisor and I'll do this often. Little intake. OK, so you choose like the type of document that you want to use. This thing defaults to behavioral health, it's just like a setting, but because there's so many different like sections and next gen, sometimes we do have to select like what section we're in. It would be like the options are like public health, all this other stuff, whatever. The unfortunate thing about showing you this is I can't show you a clean version. So there's because it's a test is already writing in here. I mean, I can click new, but some stuff is still going to carry over. So you mean to go through every field? Or you just want to look? No, we can kind of just have you walk us through the process. OK, just narrate it for you. So we choose the program name because even within behavioral health, there are different programs, like even within us, we have different locations. So we choose the correct place, start time and time. This is like accurate billing time. It's not like the appointment time. So this is like for Medicaid billing. So like the exact minute that you start and stop, which gives you the duration of the appointment, which then controls like the billing code. We do not fill out the status of medical assistance right here. And here we put the presenting concerns, why they're coming in. Toggle over to social history, which all this information is collected at the time of the assessment, you know, their living situation, family info. You know, family stuff, blah, blah, blah, developmental history, school stuff, social things. If I'm not saying enough, just tell me. But I feel like this is good. I mean, legal norms and stuff, trauma, history, sexual issues, military stuff. Then we navigate over again to behavioral health history, which includes risk assessments, safety management, different kinds of risk, history of risk, mental health, treatment history, mental status evaluation, psychiatric illness, medication, substance use assessment, a place to indicate screening tools that were used. We would like for there to be more screening tools already in there. Trackable over time, so we can see outcomes and measurements and data of it per client and be able to pull reports like, you know, for all, like one at a time and for all of them. And then we, there's a functional tab in here, but we don't use it. Our accrediting bodies and et cetera don't require any of this, so we skip it. It's just like, can, like, I don't know. It doesn't matter. And then the final page, strengths, goals for life, desires for treatment, clinicians, interpretation and formulation, assessment, or excuse me, diagnosis, physical health stuff. And then right here, importantly, information that connects to the next document that we would have to complete, which is like the beginnings of treatment planning, so like treatment goals. So, they feed through together and connect. Level of care. Sorry, just to elaborate a little bit on that, Stephanie, they feed and connect through to the treatment plan, those assessed needs. So, they populate into the treatment plan. Yep. And signatures, which is, this is a place for the clinician to sign. One thing that's a little bit wonky right now is getting, like, family signatures on documents. We don't have, like, a way of, like, we don't have, like, a signature pad, so there's sometimes, like, printing, signing, scanning. It's awkward. So, a box that, I don't know. I don't know what the county wants to resolve that issue. I could share my opinions, but I'm not sure what overall you guys are looking at to address that hole here, which is that there are a lot of signatures sometimes needed, and we currently just don't have, like, a kind of a tech-friendly way to do it. Are signatures needed to move on to the next step? Not for this. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have even said that for this one. It just came to mind. For the treatment plan, which would be the next document, they are required. So, right now, the only clinician signature is needed, which is no problem. Just click, and it goes right in. And then you can see from before the counter signature needed from a higher level clinician happens later in the PAQ. So, even if this is, like, a, what is it called, a clinical assistant, then they can sign that they've done the document, and then later a supervisor can sign off if needed. And then at the bottom, here's the behavioral health billing that goes in. A lot of it's auto-filled based upon you've already chosen the type of appointment. You've already put the time in. So, a lot of it just sort of auto-fills, and then you can choose, like, what, you know, diagnosis code, and put it in. And then. Sorry, Stephanie, can you go back to that? Oh, sorry. Oh, well. Yeah. To the billing, to show the CPT codes. I don't know if you've seen that, but they're a mess, and would hope that because of the different modifiers, Fiscal wanted us to combine the CPT codes with the modifiers, that it was easier, less billing. But then the problem is, is that then the person has to go through and read in this very small print between all of these, and it's very easy to select the wrong one. So, you see, you know, UA is under age, under 18. GT is for telework. So, this 90847UA-GT is a 45-minute with session with an under age, under the age of 18 youth on telehealth. So, but you can see that this was just added in by Fiscal, and it's very complex. It's also hard to read. It's like weird abbreviations that don't actually reflect, like, how billing, like, verbiage works. So, if you try to, like, Google, like, the billing code you need, you can't just, like, put it in. You do have to kind of slog through these, like, CNA is an odd abbreviation code. Like, we would prefer it be aligned with how Medicaid would say it, because that's what you see if you kind of go look for it on your own. Yeah. Richon? So, this is for the Dr. Cloud team. So, this is, you know, what Stephanie and Karen is highlighting is a fundamental of translation of different people in a system, right? Billing understands a thing a certain way. The staff that's doing the work understand a thing in a certain way. How do we get this language to mean the same thing to three different sets of individuals, right? And ultimately, what do we show, right? So, there is this, it's a hard task for us to get that common language and still have the right CPT code. But the issue is the actual person doing the work is taking a longer time to do it if they got to search for the meaning of everything every single time they go in here. Like, it is definitely not efficient. And actually, we'll probably pick the wrong thing. I was just going to say that. Their desire to reduce errors by combining all of the modifiers has actually, I don't know the data on this, but just from my experience, I don't think it actually reduces errors. I think it increases them because the staff don't really have a good grasp of what they're looking at. And if they go searching, they're going to see things in different language. So, like, I think there's still errors this way. So, I don't know. I think, you know, the Dr. Cloud team have experience with different groups of people using an integrated system. How do we get a common language? Or how do we get a translation? Probably the screens might be bigger anyway, Stephanie. So, we could put explanation in. All I want is to be able to make it bigger. The first thing is to make it bigger. Put all the words in. That would help. So, in our requirements capture sheet, we have the service codes that we asked for. And I think you can list out the descriptions that you want that make sense to the county. They also, there's a column for the modifiers as well. But I think the way that we kind of manage and represent them in the screen would be clearer for you. So, we'll take you through the services master list inside of the billing module as well. So, you can see that. Thank you. I know you had your hand up. Sorry. He answered my question. I was going to ask if it's a way to separate the code. Yes. We're going to collect that information. Yes. Karen and Stephanie, you guys also need to have the prepared questionnaire, right, and the medication module that is not currently available. So, that's something that we do want to highlight. Do you have it? What is not available? We have the prepare template and we have... And you have the medication modules, right? Yes. You're able to track all medications and you're able to track the doses. Yes. And everything. Yes. Prescribers prescribe from the medication module. They use the EPCS system. I didn't think we had a medication module. Cherise, do you remember that? Yeah. IT looked into doing that, but IT never got the information back so that we could proceed to purchase it from NextGen. Exactly. We've never purchased that. Well, there's something in here called medications module. That is correct, but I think... And you are correct, Stephanie and Karen. This is the way that you would prescribe going to a pharmacy, but there are some programs, school-based health, they have medications on site, like aspirin, what have you. And so, they wanted to be able to track that on site. And that would have required the medication inventory control template, which IT looked into, but the practice never purchased it from NextGen. So, that's what they're referring to. Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Cherise. So, that was the whole COMPASS. At the time of intake... Oh boy, where am I? There's also screenings that need to be done. So, we do... One of the ones we're currently using, IT had put it in here for us, and it's this questionnaire. And as, I don't know, as you can see or not see, it gets put in over time, and then you can look... This is how you enter the data, and then using here, you can kind of somewhat track the data. And I think that there's also reports that can be run from this specifically. There's some other ones in here. And there's more that I think that we would like to be in here. And we currently, though, just kind of put the information in manually or like scan copies, but we would definitely like different screening tools to be available in here. I feel like that's pretty regular, though, in software, but hopefully it's something someone's talking about. Yes, definitely. So, we have that. We do have the prepare, which I don't know, you guys. I can't find it, but it's in there. People are doing it. There it is. You passed it. Yeah. No, that's prepare history. It should be... But I didn't... Cherise, please correct me. I thought we never finished prepare. No, you did. IT did come in early, and it was sent out for folks to use it. Here it is. Prepare. Do we have it now? Yeah. We don't want it, but we have it. We have it, and we're using it. Yeah. Good, good, good. It's problematic, though, but yes. That's why they put that decline button right there. Some people don't want to answer the questions. There's a couple of questions in particular that we don't ask clients, typically. So, yeah. So, there it is. It's another screening tool. Generate. Same, same, same. So, the prepare, the OMS that I showed you, and then a couple other screenings are typically done at the same time. Everyone done with the assessment? Have any more questions about it? So, one of the things that Karen said initially, the assignment... After the assessment, I think it was about a year and a half ago or something like that. And I think it was about a year and a half ago or something like that. So, I think it was about a year and a half ago or something like that. The assignment to the staff is done, so the intake is done by anyone? Okay, sorry. The case assignment is done first, and then it is that staff that completes this task. Okay, so it's not... This is a billable visit with the therapist that has received the case. Okay, but the acuity score for the customer doesn't dictate who the case gets assigned to. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. The acuity score? I thought Karen mentioned something. Oh, no, it's not a score. It's just we... There are some cases that come from the hospital or crisis center that we just note in a different... We color-code it, so it's prioritized waitlist for those clients. But that's all done manually through Excel and email. The whole assignment, you know... That's just referral management. That's no screening. It would be nice to have a way to triage in the referral system as well. Okay, thank you. And we, I think, have sent you and can send again a copy of the referral log where you can see all the fields that we're collecting and all of the kind of variations and notations that we need to be able to say. Like, we need to be able to mark it as assigned. We need to be able to mark it as a priority. We need to be able to put notes in and follow up. So we have sent that before. We can send it again. No, we have that. No, no, we have that. So those are all the things that we're talking about in terms of how we determine, like, prioritization of assignment. Once we figure all that out and assign the case, this is the first thing that the therapist does with the case, in a billable visit in person. Okay. So we, the Dr. Claude team, Summer, we have all of that in their particular folder inside the SOPs on the SharePoint site. Okay. Ryan, this is Charisse. One of the action items IT will take away from this, particularly since some custom templates were shown, is we will give you all of the ones that IT created. In NextGen, there were forms that subsequently came into NextGen, but IT had already, like, ASAM. Those are templates that we were trying to get staff to wait until NextGen did it, but we went ahead and did it. So I will give that list to you all so that you have a sense of all of the custom templates and the assessments that were developed. Perfect. Can we give you a wish list of screening tools that we would be so happy if they were in here? Please do, because we have, I mean, when you say templates, we equate that to forms inside of Dr. Claude, and we have a library of 400-plus forms that we want to show you. The ASAM, the PHQ-9, a lot of the things that I kind of saw. I feel like the stuff we're asking for is going to be in there. Hopefully, yeah. And if not, we have a form builder tool to replicate, you know, any forms that IT or anybody else built. So there is that option. But in the interest of time, we're hoping we can just use what comes out of the box inside of Dr. Claude. Like I said, there's hundreds available, so we'll take you through that. Nice. Yeah. Do you want to see the next document? We're at one of like five. Well, where are we in the workflow, I guess? This is just the initial assessment, first visit, assessment, screenings. The next step, I can just briefly tell you, would be, Karen, I'm just going to go to treatment plan and then appointments. So the next step would be the treatment plan. After that would be like visits, like therapy sessions or medication management sessions for psychiatry. There is also the psychiatric evaluation, which is a whole other form. And then therapy sessions and then. Discharge. Family. Yeah, there's like some little quirky things like family therapy, group therapy, but they all kind of are currently in a similar format to like an individual therapy session. Sort of group therapy is I don't know that I could walk you through that because I've never done it, but it exists in there. I know somebody who could walk you through it because she currently it's Emily. How I think is to use that template, Karen. So that is who we could ask about that. But that's all the documents that I can think of in terms of visits. OK. And some of these are telehealth, correct? Yes, there's a place in the billing section. Sorry, I should have maybe. In our sheet, we have a column to identify the appointment type is telehealth or not. So, yeah, it's in somewhere. It's a little odd in the assessment, but in the visit document, you do have to indicate where the service was provided. And then it's also in the billing code. So what's the trigger for billing in our system? It's closing an encounter. And that packages everything up with billing rules and. So the same we have, it's like checking out and our admin are the ones that do that. So to review that, we would need one of them because I thousand percent don't know what how that goes. I don't know, Karen, if you've ever participated in that, but I could not even begin to show you how that works. But our admin, once the therapist has like put billing codes in, you know, generated the document, closed it out. Then the billing or the admin staff do something that like check it out. And that generates the billing and sends it along and completely closes it, finishes it. So, Ryan, that that's a little different than what other systems currently do. So usually you are able to check in, check out a patient in the front end. But then when the clinical staff and other systems are done with their note, they can just sign off on their note and that will generate the bill. Right. Like they're closing that encounter. But in this setting, they wait for that front desk to be able to push that out. You know what I mean? So I don't know if that would be the ideal scenario because you have to wait until that person close everything. Instead of when the provider is done with the notes and signing everything off. So it's not something is not linked to the system we used to have. And I don't know if this is the reason I'm just thinking out loud, but we used to have an integration with the clearinghouse to our system. We currently don't have that. So everything is sent in a different way that is not interfacing with our current EHR. OK. Yeah. We are going to connect up to the clearinghouse and Dr. Claus. Yeah. So that will eliminate a lot of manual work that they are doing. Yeah. OK. So, OK. So, Ryan, that's also another organizational thing I want to elevate. Right. And if you guys can suggest what's the industry practice on that, because I know with Montgomery County, we've done things because we're special snowflakes. Yeah. But, you know, I'm a part of the snowflake, you know, but there is there's been some I think the current practice has been influenced by some deficiencies other places. Right. So we had a clearinghouse, so we don't have one anymore. If we had one, like, would that create a different platform? And I think we're willing to explore that. OK. Same thing with the insurance verification. We currently don't have that system active in the electronic health record. So they are using different if we have three or four vendors insurances. Right. They have to log in into those portals separately and get out and try to see if the patient has an active insurance at that moment. But the time they come back to the system, the system log them off already and they have to log back in again. So it's not user friendly at all. Like, you know, so all that needs to. Yeah. You want to streamline your eligibility checking, right? Yes. I'm that also includes like our fee assessment process. I don't know if that's if you've all discussed that. Yes. Because that's another headache. Yes. Diana, you're like in my brain right now. I love it. Like everything that we're always like, oh, like you already know. Everything that you guys have mentioned before. I'm trying to think of all those things. But the fee assessment, please talk about that. What is the current flow that you have and what would you need? Because everything is so manual that they do the calculations and everything right there. Like, you know, like with a calculator, with a calculator. Yes. Yeah, the assessment process really is just that we have like a sheet of paper with questions on it. And it's like, what insurance do you have? Write it down. Do you not have insurance? Write it down. What's your income? Write it down. And then if there is insurance, then you like manually obviously are putting that in. If there is any kind of special situation where they're uninsured, they're sliding scale, there's an odd manual way of putting that in. There's no sort of like if we do any sort of special like fee arrangements, there's nothing in the system to trigger like when that would expire because we don't just like to make it open ended forever. Like maybe we want to review it every 90 days or something like that. You know, I don't even think there's anything particularly I don't even know how how they know what the fees are. To be honest with you, that might be manual. That might be on a spreadsheet to outside of the system. And so that's another admin thing that they could expand upon significantly to get you really detailed information on what would be helpful in terms of tracking. Like, you know, billable or, you know, insurance or not is in there. But then once it's not insurance, it gets all complicated and it's all manual after that. I think so. That could use some help. So one of the general requests, and I think it was in the. I think so, because I think I wrote it in one of the requirements in the RFP was the. The client payment side or the client burden fee. Right. So for service, what is the client burden and considering our service. Right. So we serve the vulnerable. Right. There are state laws as to their sliding fee scale that they have to contribute to the service by law. Yes. Right. Whether it's five dollars, two dollars or zero. And across the board, just letting people have dental and in some other programs, we need to be able to be able to do this in the system. Right. And we don't have a way to do that now. But across the board, I think that was one of the requests on managing the sliding fee or the client burden, fiscal burden piece. The the issue is and I just want to set this for everybody. The issue is this. So if you go into any normal clinic, that's not government. Right. The front desk person is also the person that has a person there that does their fiscal. So the client gets to ask some questions about what's my fee? How much am I going to pay? Do I pay anything? Right. The way we're situated, that knowledge is not necessarily with that front desk person. It's sometimes considered billing, a billing practice, and it's not with that person. That person is just doing intake. Take your name, provide a service. But there is no real model that no system model that can accommodate that. Right. Because every other clinical model, that front desk person is versed in understanding both the physical complication of someone coming in and your need for service. Great. In Montgomery County, it's kind of separate, but not. So the person that would actually have more fiscal information, like if they're OK, if they're going to pay this, if they have a payment plan, all that, that's not that intake person. But that's the person the customer sees. And that's the person that the customer is asking these questions. So we have a business challenge right now of how we get a system to help us. And you can tell us what we need. Right. So say, OK, we can provide you this. You need to provide this. Right. But I think we need to have a conversation about how we accommodate that process in all of these spaces. I just wanted to paint that picture. Absolutely. It would be nice if they could pay in portal also, because that's another very manual process where how they're just handing us money. And somehow we magically like I say magically because it's someone else that does it. But there's an admin that's doing it manually who like literally has money in their hand or a credit card payment in a slip and then has to sort of like do all this accounting work to put it into the system. So direct payments in Dr. Cloud, we still want to be able to take cash because of our client base. But there are plenty of people who would direct pay in there would greatly reduce the accounting burden on like regular admin folks. Yeah, it would be good also to generate receipts when they are making those payments, especially if it's cash, because they currently have those receipt books and they have to document how much they receive. They give the piece and then we don't have a copy or we are looking for the copy. You know, it's very difficult to keep track of that. It's very 1995 with those carbon receipts. It's not giving them 26. We lived through 95, Stephanie. I mean, I know you're very young. I was alive. I was alive. That's it, Richard. That's it. So it would be good if they can document that under the patient's information, right? Their demographical chart and then adjust the payment there real time instead of like putting it under the key part, you know, like the keyboard, the money and then trying to figure it out. And I would also include the fee waiver form while we're at it. I mean, we might as well include that, too, that the supervisor, that admin staff will have a form, a fee waiver form if the client is unable to pay. That's what I meant when I was talking about once there's no insurance, if there are adjustments or changes to the fees. Like, I personally don't think we need necessarily like separate forms and functions in a new system, but just something that can kind of track. Like, if it's insurance, there's all this information that's set. If there's no insurance, what are the arrangements? How is it tracking it? And what's being paid? Correct. Okay. Like, there could just be a tree instead of like separate things. Sure. And somewhere in that process would need to be like a decision, a determination about whether that client's fee would be waived that a supervisor would need to sign off on. I'm going to ask for something that is crazy, probably not existent, but, you know, I can only dream. Historically, especially in this area in behavioral health, they have been able to check out patients and label an entire year as non-billable, right, as an example. The reason why is not because this service is non-billable, but because other reasons. Let's say at that moment they were not credentialed with an insurance, for example, right? Oh, at that moment, the program didn't have their credentialing, either the program or the provider, and they just check those visits non-billable, even though they were all billable services. So, I don't know if there is a way in the EHR they can be alert that these services are billable. And maybe they would be able to do like a tier two and add that to another provider who is currently billable, you know what I mean, or credentialed so that we don't just write off all of that money that is just sitting there. No need to give you an answer. Think about it. I know it's crazy, but a way for them to know that it is a billable service and for them to sign on saying like, do you understand this is a billable service? You know, like a hard stop to let them know, or at least an alert to say, hey, these are billable services, instead of them just checking everything on like non-billables. Because when we run the report for non-billables and we go inside the actual list, it gives me a list of patients that currently do have an insurance, do have a billable services, but they were all checked out as non-billable. Right. Okay. So, yeah, mechanism to sort of check, right? A final check on billable versus non-billable. Yeah. Okay. With the 15 minutes we have left, so I heard a number of kind of features and capabilities that we have in Dr. Plowd called out. Chris, are you able to pull up the demo system? From what you heard, where do you think is a good place to start? I thought we should maybe show what the supervisor's signature queue looks like. The staff dashboard would be good to show. If we can do maybe a high-level just view of the multidisciplinary treatment plan, that would be good. And if there's time, maybe we can maybe talk about the, maybe the billing manager or the fee sheet. Any thoughts? Yeah, I'm definitely curious to see the treatment plan because that has been a dinosaur with the NextGen. I'd love to see all of that, and I'd love to, if there's a future meeting, maybe bring our admin in and look at the fee stuff because we can give you our opinions, but they could really, like, get into, you know, get in there. Diana has a very good view right down to hiding receipts under the keyboard of how we do things, but our admin can also chime in on, like, specific process. Sure. Yeah, I think. Yeah, the rest of it, the staff, supervisor, treatment plan, that's very interesting to me. Yeah. Also, when they are not, when they feel that it's a lot of pressure, they are checking in, checking out patient, answering calls at the same time, the front desk. The problem that they are running into is that they might check the patient as, you know, like, waiving the fees, but not, it's not always accurate, like, because they know what it's going to take for them to get that calculation, and they're going to have to ask all this bunch of questions. Some of them, they will just go to the next step, you know what I mean, and sign a waiver, like, don't worry about it, Ms. Charles just signed this, and they go, right? But if we can help them to improve that intake system that they don't, they currently have, getting out of this view and going to another screen with an actual spreadsheet that they are using to calculate, if we show you that spreadsheet, it's a headache. Like, you have to look into what bracket that person will fall, and then you determine with the calculator whether they owe you $5, $10, $100, you know, like, whatever that is, based on the few schedules. Yep. And it doesn't save that, so it's every single time. Yeah. It's every time, yes. It will never save. Chris, are you in a position to share your screen and walk the group through some of those capabilities? Not sure. No. Chris, are you there? I think he's. Muted, so he might be having a technical issue. Yeah. We can hear you now. That's Neil, not Chris. Oh, sorry. That's okay. I'm not sure if he's having technical issues, he's not responding, but I am. So, Ryan, we can bring back. Yeah. Yeah, because this is a general thing for anyone. Sure. So, when we do, after we do these meetings, we can bring. back groups of people to talk through certain functionalities in the system because we haven't done the demo with the staff yet. So, we can circle back Stephanie, Arnecia, Karen, right? We can circle back on this. His mic is not working, but he can hear everything, so just one second. So, we can talk about him? Okay, because he can't respond. Let's just see if he can. Screen should work. Microphone right now. Yeah. I'm a subtitle reader, so. You want to dial in on your phone, Chris, to the mic portion of the meeting? Maybe that'll work. So, you're trying to talk, Chris. Yeah, can you hear me now? Yes. Yes. Okay. A bit of an echo on your computer. So, we lost your audio, Chris, if you're talking. Yeah, I'm just trying to unmute on my computer. Okay. Okay. Is that better? Yes. That was good. Thanks. Okay. So, what I'm sharing here is the Dr. Cloud system. You guys see my screen? Yes. So, the way the system is laid out is we have the top banner here in the light blue section. That's what we refer to as the client banner, and the reason we refer to it that way is because when I selected a client from the search menu, I can look at my most recently selected clients, and when I selected a client, it shows them and their information up here in the top section. So, this is the client that I'm currently working with, and then I have this dark blue main navigation bar across the middle top here, which allows me to navigate to the different areas of the system, and we maintain the layout of the screen at all times, so it's easy to navigate. You always know where you are in the system. When I click on one of these menu options, it shows me in the sidebar menu a list of the menu options that are available to me there, and one of them is the option for the supervisor or the person who's that a reviewing provider of the forms. They would click on review forms, and then this is the list of forms that they need to review, and they click on the form name that they want to review, and then they can scroll down here and see the form down below, and they're just looking at the form to see how it was filled out, and once they review it, then they can assign a status of approval, and they would just check approve here, and that would move them to the next form in the queue, or they can go back, and they can click on the same form, and they can go back, and they can say, no, I actually need to reject this form, and if they reject it, then they would put in the reason for the rejection in the box there, and that would send a notification to the provider that originally filled out the form why it was rejected, and then they could have a chance to make changes or fix the form if they need to. So, once they're finished reviewing all the forms, then they would, they have a summary here on the left-hand side that they would then sign off on by checking the box here to apply their signature, and in the Dr. Cloud system, you're just entering your signature pin or password every time you're signing a form, and then you would just say sign, and then submit that, and that would submit your review of those forms, and so once the the form is filled in, then, oh, I need to put in something here, please complete, and then submit that review, and now in my inbox for the message center, I have a notification that would say that I have a form that was rejected right down here at the bottom, and I can click this arrow key, and it would take me to that encounter for that client, where I can go ahead and make the corrections to the form that I need to, so it's just taking a second for it to load up here, but that's the review process, and then in terms of the dashboard, I can go to a link here at the top that shows me my current caseload view, and I can see whether I'm assigned to the care team for this client or the primary provider, and we also have the rules around when forms need to be completed in the episode of care, and so these icons with the red faces are letting me know that my status of compliance with those is that I'm not in compliance, and if I go up here to the top, I can see the statuses of the forms that I need to complete based on those rules that are set up, and I can also access the form right from the dashboard here by clicking this little pop-up icon, and this is a treatment plan, so I can go in and see what the treatment plan looks like, and when I come in here, it's going to show me here's my treatment plan. I can edit the plan. Wow, that's exciting. And it's loading up the plan here, and when I go to the, I've got the conditions, the identified needs, and we can adjust the way that you enter the areas of treatment in the treatment plan, but if you have a an identified need, so we can add an identified need, and we would say this is going to be, maybe this person has a need for housing, and I can say this is related to my living situation, starting on a date, and then save that need, and then I would go in and add my objectives for that need, as well as the interventions and services we're going to be providing in support of that, so we have a housing need. We can also click on this guide, and it will show us a list of predefined textual options to insert into this form, into this treatment plan, so we can say this is related to we'll just insert that one, so then we would add our objective, and we do the same thing with the objective. We can have a library of those that we just click on, and then that inserts, or we can additionally edit the text after we insert the text of the standard, and then we can add, these are the services that we're going to be providing in support of that objective, and then we're going to say what type of provider is going to be providing that. Richard's got a hand up. Again, I think this is just for summer, so there needs to be an alignment, because this is also talking about a care plan. Yeah. Sorry, Chris, I think. But there's other systems where the care plan is the same. It's the same. That we already worked through. That we already worked through. Just kind of need to align it. Chris, you might need to mute. Okay. I was muted, so I'm not sure why that was in that, but was there anything else we wanted to look at today? We only have two minutes left, so I mean, I made a number of notes, and again, we'll go back with the team and go through the requirement sheet, making sure we're asking for the right data collection based on what we heard today. So, let's circle back. I think the goal is to populate as much of the staging system as we can, and then pull in those admins or other folks that we can kind of show how it's being built out and get more feedback. Is there anything from the county side you want to raise in the last two minutes? No, Steph, Chris, Karen, if you can send me the notes that we talked about, and I do have the spreadsheet already. So, if you want to send me an updated one, it's fine, and the Doctor Cloud team should have access to that. So, whatever you shared with me before, they have. But if you have notes on enhancement, that would be good, and I'll share them. Yeah, I think the notes about the caseload requirements and stuff, about how we track that, I don't think we said that to you before, so I'll send that to you. Okay. Well, thank you. This is very helpful. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thanks for your time. I appreciate this. Thank you, Neil. Bye-bye. Thank you, everyone. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
