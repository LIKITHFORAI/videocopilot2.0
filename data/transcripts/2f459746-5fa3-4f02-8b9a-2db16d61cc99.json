  "text": "Summer, do you have a – or maybe Neal – like, screenshots or just a set of steps to access NextGen once people are logged into the county network, sort of like an icon? Do you know, Neal? I do. I can forward it to you all. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. It's not me, but it's the four people on our team I am hounding to make sure that they verify their NextGen access today. Yeah. Okay. I can forward you the document that I received from Surya. Perfect. Yeah. Just send it to the team, will you? And include Surya from our team. It should be on some of your notes. It's Neal, Chris, Surya, and Ramesh who should have the NextGen access. Okay. Yeah. She sent – she forwarded it on the email as well. I'll make sure they get it. Perfect. I'll get the one that she sent to me. Thanks, Samit. Hi, everyone. This is Adli. Hello. Hi, Adli. Good morning – or good – actually, noon. Afternoon. Yeah. Right after noon here is a good – good morning, everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Thank you all for joining this meeting. We can go ahead and get started. I'm just for transparency purposes this, this meeting is being recorded, and this recording will be uploaded to the SharePoint site. I can give you anyone has any objections to that I'll defer that to Dr. Nimbard, but we can go ahead and get started. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining. We can, let's just get started where we left off the last time in terms of the other tabs in the spreadsheet. Yes, I think today's focus was billing, and some of the claim information so I've invited Sam Williamson and Hema Bhanguru from the Dr. Cloud side who are our billing and claim experts. Do you want us to start on the demo part of ours first before we go to the spreadsheet or? Sure, whatever's most efficient for Nimbard. We can start, we can start on our side. Taylor, are you ready? We're just going to do some generic walkthroughs. Yeah, hold on one second. I actually think it would probably be easier if they start on their side to show what they're trying to pull, and then I can kind of, are you guys just trying to see like a claim being created? Yeah, we want to, let's just see what we do on our side. And then we can, then we can have the other conversation. Actually, I'm going to kick that. Beth, can you just create a claim out of the test one that Xiomara was doing on Friday? Yeah, you just need a live demo. Yeah, give me two seconds. Let me log into PM. I know I'm going to get a lot of errors, though, because a test patient is not going to. So do you want to see the whole checkout process or just populate a claim? I think for this purpose, we just need to populate a claim. So you can just add a charge in and populate a claim. OK, let me just see if any of these have claims that I can just, I guess I'll just create a new encounter. So I'll just do like Amerigroup, or that's all right. This is already here. Never mind. OK, sorry. I'm sorry, I should have been more prepared. I didn't know I was going to be doing this. So I just want to say sorry. No, I put you on the spot. You're fine. OK. Hello, everyone. Oh, wow, it went through. OK, so now I'm going to say so. I just created this claim. So do you want me to go in and open what it looks like? OK. Yeah. Can you open the claim? Thank you. Yes. Just let me know what you want me to do. So that's pretty much it from our side. So when you guys are looking for rules, are you looking for all the rules for what we have populated into each field of this claim form? For each type of insurance? Yes. So inside of the requirements sheet, you know, please have that ready to go. You'll see that we're asking for information on, I guess, service codes and air information and, you know, what gets pulled into the claim form. So. So, Taylor, correct me if I'm wrong, but. These are our this is our claim edit library. Do we just like want a screenshot, which like Medicare and Medicaid and. No, that's not a good idea. It's not. I mean, that will be the start, but we do have some where we're pulling different MPIs where we did it within the insurance within the pay. OK. Yeah. So it's not all all of our claim information is not just in one place easily to be pulled. So this would give you kind of like the standard of what we're pulling into each, you know, kind of box. But then there are modifications based on payer, which are in the payer section. Does that kind of make sense? Yes. So you're asking for us to consolidate all of that into one on this on this Excel spreadsheet that you're doing. Well, there's two tabs. Right. So the first one is the billing rules. And I think that is like what services get billed to which pairs. I think there might be modifiers on there. I'm not sure. So I'll ask the team to keep me honest and confirm that. Can I flip? I'm going to flip that open while you're talking, if you don't mind. Yeah, that's quite if that's OK. You know, maybe you can pull it up real quick and we can level set there, grab the screen and let's go to the billing and claims. And Sam and Hema, if you guys can jump in with your what we're asking for inside of this. And I think there's a couple of hand raises as well as pulling stuff up. Yeah. Let's go ahead and do questions. Beth, can you can you do me a favor and upload that claim form into the chat for me, please? Are all the forms like that? Yes. For the most part, they're all that format, but they pull out different information. We've asked the Amara. She went and pulled and ran claims for all of our our main insurance companies. Right. So our MCOs, our Medicaid, our Carolines. And she's working on the private one. So we'll have examples for each one. So it's just a matter. And that's in a folder. We'll move that over to the SharePoint folder once that's done later today. So I have an example for each payer as well. And then. So, yes. So not only this one here for this example, but we'll have an example for, I want to say, 60 percent of our payers. There's some payers we don't really use. They're just in there as shales, kind of like AARP, for example. We didn't run those yet just for the sake of time because we just didn't have the time to pull those on such short notice. No, the main ones are fine. That template, though, that is it. Right. There's there's no template based on payer. So there is. So there's a template for each type, right? Medicaid, Medicare kind of is what Beth was showing with the claim edits. Yes. And then there are modifications based on payers. Some payers want to pull the provider MPI. Right. Some payers want the location MPI or they want. What's the one we were just working on about a month ago, Beth, where we changed that thing for Kaiser? I think it was Aetna. Aetna. Right. Do you remember what that was? Yeah, they. They wanted a taxonomy code that other payers weren't asking for. So what we did was we actually first started with just Aetna and then we ended up just putting it in all the groups so it would go over. But yes, it was it was a taxonomy code that wasn't standard with other payers. Right. So did it find its way in? I think what I'm trying. But one second, Chris, I know you're showing that. Can you show that template again for me real quick? Which template? I'm so sorry. The one. The last one. The claim. Yeah, the claim. OK, yeah, absolutely. Let me get right back there. Can you see? So the other. The other thing before this. Yeah. Oh, the the actual claim. Yes, that one. So this one. No, it's OK. So this form is have all the possible information. Right. And if they need a different thing, is this form edited? Is there space for everything is what I'm saying. Is there one form and as needed, we'll add data to this or is it a different iteration of this form every time? It's wonderful. All claims go out on the electronic 1500 form. OK. Yes. Yes. That's what I want to know. All right. And then based on certain situations, some data is populated and some aren't. Right. Correct. Perfect. All right. That's that's what I want. And to be honest, 90 percent of it's the same. Right. It's just certain payers have certain tweaks. Right. It's the two percent tweaks, three percent tweaks. So that kind of makes sense. OK. No problem. I just want to know. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead. Makari, I'm sorry. No problem. Actually, I think we answer based on your question that most of the most of my questions are answered. I just have one additional small one. So is there any situation where you use specific rules or programs? I understand, obviously, different services, different pay your rules. Are there anything that would be unique from one program to the other other than just regular services and payer information? I mean, dental. Right. Because dental uses. What is it? The ADA? I think it is. But for the most part, everything else is the same. I want to say, Beth, correct me if you see something different or. Yeah, it's either the 1500 form or it's the ADA form here. So to correct myself, Richard, I think dental uses the ADA, not the 1500. Sorry. Yes. Oh, OK. Perfect. I forgot. I just added dental a year ago. So I would know that dental is special. So, yeah. Yeah. So, OK. So dental will be a different template in this case. We're not using the regular 1500. OK. Correct. Correct. OK. With that, just curious, would that be like a UB04, like old days, like style, like UB04, like as if it's a facility or it's a completely different thing? Sorry. Would you like me to just while we're talking, just go ahead and get an ADA form? Yeah, I'll do that while we're talking. Yeah, no problem. I got it. Thank you. Chris, can you please walk the group through the columns and the information we're asking for and see if they're clear? And then if you see anything, Chris, Sam or Hema or Neil that we're missing or would be helpful to collect or educate the county on what we're looking for, please raise that. Go ahead, Chris. So this is the billing rules. So what we're essentially looking for is when there are cases that you have a code that gets added to a visit or service and then needs to change for some reason, typically because the payer has a requirement, because it's a different type of payer, whether Medicaid or commercial. And then if there's modifiers need to get added based on the provider certification or the parameters of the service, then this is what this spreadsheet is asking for. So we're we're asking if there is a first of all, the description of what this is services providing in that first column. A and then in B would be the service code that's added by default. And then the charge for that service code and then the units. And then what should trigger the change, the change would be something like the payer is different or payers Medicaid or payers Medicare, whatever the case is. And then what we want to know in column F would be the resulting service code. So after, you know, we're billing to Medicaid or different payer or whatever the case is, there's a change in the service code. We want to see that in the next column F and then G would be the modifiers that need to be added or that changed as a result of that parameter being in place, different payer or different provider type or whatever the case is. And then if there's a change in the place of service because of the rule or because of the parameters of the service, then we'd be looking for that in column H. And then the resulting charge, if it's different, and then the units and how we're calculating the units, if, you know, if it's a, if it starts out a session based and then moves to her time based unit. So the units are calculated based on the amount of time spent. Then we'd want to know that in that column K and then any notes around what we're trying to accomplish with this rule would be what we're looking for in that column L. So then I guess this is more of an internal question for Richen. We technically don't do that or have rules like this set up. It's more manual. I, you know, and this would probably fall more into, you know, I know to tenders made some recommendations for, you know, for drug court, for example, to use a certain code when they bill Medicare. And I know Joyce Bryant changes some codes based on when she bills Medicaid or Medicare. But right now our whole system is manual when it comes to this. Are you still looking to have that set up? And if so, it probably needs to go their direction. Yeah, I would want it set up initially. When you when you do your billing for most of your billing right now, is it by units, sessions? Units are time, yeah. By generic, right? Yes. And when you say bills, so just to clarify, right, we just push the bills out. Right. It's the locations and the providers that are choosing whether, you know, what's being put on and whether or not they're using units. And then I only know that answer because we build the information into the system. So, you know, most of the system we build either 15 or 30 minute increments. And then, you know, they could put whether or not they're using two or three units. So that kind of makes sense what I'm saying. Yes. So that's why the rules would really have to go back to, like, your drug court. I know your tenders help them with some of the coding stuff and what to use. But it would really need to go back to them because they're the ones that decide, you know, whether, you know, whether they need to change it for a certain, you know, payer or not. And then, you know, when we get an error or denial, we'll let them know and they may go back and flip it. But it really does fall on them as far as what, you know, what they're using when they select the payer, if that kind of makes sense. Can I ask a very green clinical question? Yes. Both to you, Taylor, and the Dr. Cloud team. What is the basic code billing for some of these services as you've seen them now? Right. And here's what I'm asking. Right. Because I think what I do, I want to start with the generic. Right. So for. Let's say group. We know groups are normally billed to Medicaid in this format, in this units of service, in this. Right. So there's some generic policies around how to bill for certain CPT codes. Does that exist? Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's not a matter of you can bill the CPT code to the payer. Right. So all payers. It's just a matter of whether or not you get reimbursed for that. Right. So sometimes Medicaid wants to see this CPT. Right. Medicaid will only cover this CPT code. Right. And Medicare covers this CPT code. But they do relatively the same thing. So it's not a matter of doing something incorrectly. It's just a matter of, you know, sending out the correct CPT code in order to obtain funding or, you know, obtain payment. OK, so let me ask a question a different way then for the CPT code. Is there any policy around the type of units that need to be built appropriately for these codes? And I'll give you an example again. We are. We're we're billing for therapy sessions. Right. Oh, for this specific therapy with this CPT code, the bill should be every 30 minutes, every 45 minutes, every 15 minutes. Right. Or every 60. I'm trying to figure out if there is any generic flavor about what they expect the bill to look like for certain codes. Yeah, so to answer your question, so behavioral health codes that we set up, we have them billed to units, and it's based on time. So when the provider's in the EHR, it has a little clock, and it says, how much time did you spend with this client? And it's 45 minutes, that could be three whole units. You know what I'm trying to say? So that's how it's based out of the EHR time frame that they put on the clock, it's like a little calculator. Okay. So, all right, so I think I have my answer, and I'm trying to ask the Dr. Clout team if understanding these codes, because they're not new, right, and you've actually done this work before, what are the units associated with the code that's in your base development? Am I making sense? I'm not making sense. I don't know if we have any, like, defaults, everyone's different, but I'll ask my team. Sam and Hema, are there any defaults? Yeah. Usually, there are two types of code, like one is time-based code, and one is like session-based. Okay. A code can be either one of them, not both, but it has to be like one of the type. So when you say it's a time-based code, it can be a 15-minute time-based or 30 minutes per unit. So that's all can be defined in the Dr. Clout feature. You can set it up. It's configurable, Dr. Nambard. No, and that's fine. I think what I want to know, your understanding of the code and what's normally built is this. What I prefer us to not having to do is to manually go through each and every one and tell you. If you had the codes, and you know these codes are time-based versus blah, blah, blah, right, because of the work that's done, I'm thinking, does that exist, is what I'm saying. It doesn't exist because different customers will say their particular code may be associated with a session, and that may be a different time. It may be 30 minutes versus 60 minutes. So that's why it's all configurable. Yeah, but time versus session is different, is why I'm asking. Yes. That's different. Okay. All right. I was trying to avoid some work. McCurry? A lot of that, I think, though, will be outlined when we provide the, in the service codes that I provided, because I think there's a column in there for time interval, which we're trying to pull over into that spreadsheet. So a lot of that will already be predefined there, and correct me if I'm saying something incorrect, Dr. Clow. Steve? Yeah. Steve, sorry to jump in. I think maybe the question, if I'm understanding it correctly, you're looking for general rules that we already have that we know about CPT code. So for example, that CPT code can only be used for 60 minutes, and you cannot use it for a 55-minute session. So rather than you providing us with the whole list, I think the question is more about the general CPT code rules that can be used rather than we reinvent the wheel of providing the CPT code rules. Is that where you're going with the question? Yes. Because I would like us to modify the basic general thing you have than telling you, oh, okay. Because it's probably the same thing. You know what I mean? You understand what I mean? Like if 50% of it is already the general workings of a CPT code, then Taylor don't have to tell you every single – you guys get me? We don't have to say these. We can only modify, okay, this is already the way it is. We use this the way it is. We use this the way it is. We use this. We use this. We use this. Because this is a lot of work. So I'm trying to figure out, you know, we've got a million codes. So I'm trying to figure out, like, okay, if we use the generic way the code is supposed to be built anyway, why already type it up front, right? We're literally just validating what you have is more what I was thinking. And the reason for that is because we have two teams that Taylor is saying, right? So we have the billing team and we have the billing team. We've got two. So if Taylor was like, listen, for this definition, I need these people to do this. For this other thing, I will do it. You know what I mean? It's easy for me to work on actually to give you something back. Make sense? Yeah. That's what I was kind of getting at. Sam and Hema, do you know what they're saying? Do we have anything that you would use as a base for an implementation, or do you always go off of the spreadsheet and what the customers provide us? I guess it really just depends if what type of agency, like CCBHC, in Nevada, you know, they have an allowable service grid that we can, you know, use that we have access to. This is Marilyn. So I guess it just, yeah. Okay. If you can provide us something, it's fine. I'm going to say most of that's already built in our CPT code, though. So when we pull that over, correct me if I'm wrong, Beth, but I think when we pull that over, we already have what we're using, but I think the real question that you're asking is whether or not we lock it, where if somebody doesn't, like if somebody does 45 minutes, are we saying, or I guess, Dr. Cloutiem, are you used to people saying if there's a 15-minute code and a 45-minute code, if somebody hits that 45-minute mark, that it locks the 15-minute code out and they have to use a 45-minute mark? Are you used to people setting up rules like that? Does that kind of make sense, what I'm saying? Yeah, totally makes sense. Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead, Chris. Yeah. I was just going to say we can select the code based on the amount of time spent. So if that's a rule, you know, if we say if this amount of time, you know, this is a time-based code and this is the amount of time spent, this is what the coding actually needs to end up being, then that's what we can also use the billing rules for. So when they're choosing their, right, you put the diagnosis code in, right, then you put, you know, the services you performed. And then when you're choosing your units, right, you're saying they can now put in the number of, the amount of time. So they can do, like, do they do, like, from one to three and it calculates it for them? Or are they put in a 45 minutes or, you know, I think the way we do it is, like, you select three units and it's like, each unit is 15 minutes. Right. And I don't, and I think what I'm getting at, Taylor, is I don't want that at all. I want people to just put their time in and the system's supposed to know how to break up units. And that's how it works in DrCloud. Okay, perfect. You just put in the start and stop time and then the units will be calculated for them. Okay, perfect. But then they cannot select a session CPT code for, that's where I'm getting, where I need the distinction. Right. So you can select a session CPT code, right, if you're now putting in a time. If you're doing sessions and session has to be set up a certain way, right. So Taylor, let, I think we can provide this. I just want it, I want less churning on our provider side. Right. And I guess my question is, you say that's how it works in DrCloud. Does that mean the rule has to be set up for it to work in DrCloud? Well, we have defaults attached to each service. Okay. So, you know, if you, if this service is always a build as a session-based CPT code, then that'll just be the default and it'll pull through the claim. But if there's a change that's needed where we're saying, oh, well, if we're billing this to Medicaid, then we need to change it to a HCPCS code, then that would be an example of a rule when providing certain, you know, certain services. Right. Okay. Okay. And then I guess my other question is, is this considered a rule? We do have bundled billing. Would that be considered a rule? And when I say bundled billing, just to clarify, it means this person has to be seen three times, but you can only bill one of the services. That would be a rule also. Yeah. Right. So, we would, we would, we would use the billing rules to say, you know, when we're providing this service, we have to use those parameters and look for the number of services, and then, and then we can set that up to do that. Right. So, yeah. Per person? So, this really needs to go, and this would take a little time to build. But I think it needs to be both. Both. I agree with you 100%. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So, will you, will you be able to start it, and we work on the other side while you're doing that? I, it would make more sense for them to start it, and then we, we spot check from a billing side to say this doesn't make sense. Right. Because they're going to know, we're going to need to see what they're trying to do with it to say, hey, no, this isn't going to pass, or Medicaid won't pay for this, like, can we use this? Right. So, what we do on our side now is, when we see an error, we say, hey, this is the error, and Medicaid won't bill for this. Can you use this? So, really, it makes more sense for them to spot it, and, and, because that's how it's done now, is they put it in, they select it, they know what they're trying to select, they know what rules would benefit them the most, we do more of a spot check just to make sure we're clear, you know, the billing system, and we get paid for it. All right. So, we're probably doing it. So, we're actually trying to put most of that in the system now on the front end to be inside. Exactly. Okay. So, for this, then, do we, how would we populate this? Do you want us to populate all the codes? So, we're going to populate the service codes, right? We're working on that now. All right. Okay. We're populating the service codes, but for this, this is really just selecting the exceptions, and the biggest benefactor of this would probably be Joyce Bryant and the drug court team. Do you think of anybody else that does bundling off the top of your head, Beth? No. Yeah. I don't know how you can set up a rule per person, how you would know this person. That's not our decision to make. All right. Bye. We put the rule on there and see what Dr. Clarkson did. Yeah. Yeah. Let's just make the program do what they want to do, Beth, like just, so here's what I was saying. Actually, the bundle billing, yeah, but that's not, you know what, let me just get that out of my head. It's an SEPH. Medicaid and Medicare, which would be- Nah, it's an SEPH thing that I'm thinking about, Taylor, and they're in the other system, so I need to deal with that on the other side with the bundle billing. Okay. The two primary people that I'm thinking of that this would benefit the most will be, when I say people, I mean locations, would be your drug court location and ABH. ABH. Okay. All right. Because they deal with the most Medicaid and Medicare. Okay. All right. So for the billing rules fiscal, that billing rules tab, right, I think what I'm trying to figure out, if this is going to be populated with the codes, and then we do the rules along the codes, or I think physically I'm trying to figure out how we're populating this particular tab. So I can give you my opinion, right? My recommendation would be that you get the leadership and the billing people for drug court and ABH in a room with us, and we do a one to two-hour working session. Because they're going to say what we want, we can help them to put it into this terminology for this tab. Does that kind of make sense? Okay. But you're not the only one. But you're going to do the rest though, right, because the rest are generic rules. Everything else is probably going to be a generic rule from what I'm hearing from Dr. Cloud. Yes. They're the ones that have the most exception and the most manual rule setup that they need to do. And that's okay. So the ones that are generic, are you putting that in, or you're putting that in also, right? It's my understanding from Dr. Cloud, that will be set up based on the CPT codes that we input in the units there. Is that correct, Dr. Clouty? Correct. Correct. And in which tab does that go? It's like five, six tabs back. That's the one I'm working on now. Okay. All right. I just... It's the Service Codes tab. And that's when I will know the session versus units kind of thing, right? Can you go to the Service Codes tab, whoever is sharing screen now, if they don't mind real quick. I'm sorry. I don't mean to boss somebody around. Okay. So the Service Codes tab. So here you'll see the SIM, and then like column F says time or unit of service, right? Column G says time interval. So that's based on what we're using now. This is the deal. On F, this is where I'm... This is it. On F, we're just using alphanumeric data says time. G says how much. I'm trying to understand that sheet. Correct. So it's 15 minutes. So if I say time in F, I say 15 minutes. If I say time in F, I say 45. That's my understanding of the sheet, but I'll let them speak on that. Yes. Just to clarify. Sorry. Go ahead. It's fine. Dr. Cloutin. Yeah, that's exactly right. This is where we collect those billing codes. And then the assumption for the time ones is that the provider is putting in the time spent, and this would be calculated. Correct. In terms of unit. Okay. So Taylor, we're on the same page with that, right? Yes, we are. Correct. Okay, perfect. So when we do sessions, what is in column G for sessions? So I guess that would go, I mean, my guess is it would always be one, right? Yeah, it would just be, so you could put session there. Yeah. I was leaving it blank, but I can put whatever. Okay, no, but I want to make sure. So F, once you pick session on F, you're not picking anything on G, and the assumption is one to one. Perfect. That's my understanding, yes. Okay. So if it's a system, if it's a session type code, right, they're going to, what are they selecting? Is it the way we set up the session, and it's checked out complete, or do they have to pick number of session? Give me some help here. So I don't think session's always a session, right? So for example, if you take dental, right, they may do, let's say it's a root canal. That's a CPT code, right? Technically, that's not a session, it's a service, right? So I'm considering session more like service, perform, not necessarily session, and then time would be more for the behavioral health team, where it's time intervals. But a session, for example, if they end up fixing three root canals, right, I'm being a little exaggerated here, right, but they end up putting three root canals, they would end up putting three sessions or services. Okay, so that's what I need to be very clear that that's what we mean, because that's what I understand, but the DrCloud team need to tell me that this session is a service occurrence. Yeah, that's correct. Okay, so they don't even need to put time, right? Anything out of time, we're assuming a session table, and it's a service. That is my assumption, yes. Okay, perfect. That makes sense. All right. Then, all right. Okay, so we're good. We're good. Taylor, what I would like to do is, if there, I mean, I will look over the sheet, but I would want to link any, I want to link this tab to the rules tab. So if when you're doing this, if you can call the name the same. Yeah, so they would be called the same, and that's why we would need the behavioral health team, because they're the ones that would say, this CPT code goes with this rule. Like when I'm, like they were the one that would say, hey, we manually take these four CPT codes and change them to this, these four CPT codes when we bill Medicare, or, you know, these three CPT codes, we wait for the third billing occurrence to happen before we bill one and then zero out the other two. So that's where we would need their input on. That's fine. And, but if we go back, Chris, I think, Chris, is Chris sharing? Chris, are you the one sharing? No, I am. Oh, Neil's sharing. Oh, Neil's sharing. Neil, if you go back to the billing rules one, billing rules tab. So you see, this is what I'm talking about. I like spreadsheets to be set up a certain way. You see that, which column in this is linked to the code column? That's the thing I want to know. So in a service code fiscal, which column in here would link the billing rules fiscal? Column B. Column B, so starting service code. And is it called the same thing in the billing one, in the? Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes. Service code fiscal. Go to service code fiscal. I need, then, I need to. It's just called code and fiscal. Yes. We call it the same thing. So I need, because we're going to have people working in this. So that one right there needs to be the same thing, because I want it to be linked, if that's possible, Neil, right? So can we just call that service code there, Neil, if that's okay? Yeah, just call it service code, and it will be the same across all the things, and we'll link it that way. The other one says starting service code. Do you want that on there like that, or just? I don't think we need starting. We don't need starting. Just say service code. Because I think the starting part is the code that it starts with, and then you'll probably have an ending service code for the code that it ends with. So keep the starting part there, right? Because then you have, right, because service code is now consistent, right? Because resulting service code means the code that it's changing to. So you can't put service code twice on this one, but at least if they're both called service code, I think is what she's trying to say is if we say service code, then it's consistent across the spreadsheet. Yeah, we're good. Because then you have resulting service code to take the ending service code. So we're good with this sheet. Correct. Okay. Okay, Taylor, so at least let me know how you start the work, of course, and let's bring in the team that needs to do the exceptions. Okay. Okay. Sorry, sadly, I just have a very quick point. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. No, no, no worries. I mean, regarding your point about the session times, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page. I think we're talking about two different, similar things, but two different a little bit because as you all mentioned, like dental procedure, that's the service code, that's the CPT code provided, but a session time will make a difference in something like a behavioral health. So for example, a 60-minute session, or to be more specific, more than 53 minutes, psychotherapy would be 90837. In this case, that code is associated with the time of the session. It might be both psychotherapy, but how long was it? Just taking it as an example here. So those like still session time, I know because we just mentioned that session time doesn't make a difference. No, no, Makari, I think what we're trying to say, so what we're trying to say for that service code tab, right, where we have the word session and time together, it should be time and service because we know session and time is the same thing. So where it's, there's no session, session and time is the same thing. Yes, no, no, no, I hear you there. So we're on the same page. Okay. Just want to make sure we're good. Yeah, we're good. So the only thing I would like us to do for the service code tab though, if we want to do it this way and uncomplicated, Neil, real quick, if you split out, if you go back to your service code tab, the service code physical tab. So time or unit of session, can we just change that to service, time or service? Because we already know time is our sessions and it's going to confuse folks. So time or what? Or service. Because we know time is our sessions, right? So that's already, that already covers it. But this one, is it a time thing or is it just sessions? I mean, sorry, services, right? Like the dental cleaning, those are just services. And once we put time, we put something, if we put service, there's nothing in G. Okay. Got it. Okay. That's my questions for the billing rule tab. Any questions again for the billing rules tab? Beth Taylor? I don't have any questions. Sorry, I'm muted. We do group billing as well. Would that be a rule or is that kind of somewhere else in the Dr. Cloud system? And when I say group billing, I mean like group sessions? So the coding is going to be, you know, whatever it's going to be for the groups. And we end up billing the groups as individual claims against each client. Oh, okay. Well, okay. Right. Yeah, that's the same way that we do it now. Okay. And then I think there was one more tab after the billing rules tab. Oh, the other one was the claims rule. It's just open. Yeah, we can look at it. If you don't mind, can you zoom in a little? Yeah. Thank you. Just tell me when. That's good. Thank you. Just because it doesn't use all the columns. No worries. So yeah, this tab is really asking if you have specific payer claim field requirements, you know, like Box 24J needs to have the provider NPI or the facility NPI and so the provider NPI, those kinds of things. So if you have any claim, because we can actually modify the claims to how they need to be, any box on the claim form, we can modify it so that it matches what the payer is expecting to see on there. So if you have payer specific requirements around claims being filled out a certain way, we just need to document that on this tab. Okay. So this is for the exceptions only. Yes. Is there another tab for how our claims are set up or do you just pull the standard information? We just pull the standard information, just what we would expect to go on the claim. So any exceptions to that would be documented here. Okay. And then is there somewhere where we can see the standard information that is pulled? Yeah. In the system, there is a place where you can see the claim rules and those have the data that we're putting in there and we will show you that. Okay. Because it would be nice just to verify that those claim rules match our claim rules and then we may have further questions based on that if that kind of makes sense as well. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And we figure that'll be the case. I mean, once we go through showing you how the claim rules work, then, you know, we'll answer all the questions at that time. Okay. Okay. Beth, do you have a question with this? I think we're set on where we need to go with this one. It just will take a little time because, unfortunately, you got to go payer by payer. Yeah. Yeah. I'm good. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I wasn't sure if this was asking for the claim rules as well as the exceptions at the same time. So, that clarifies that. Great. So, Taylor, does that mean we're putting both in here? No. We're just putting the exceptions in here. Okay. And then you have the default claim rules already built. So, when they show us the system, we'll compare their claim rules versus the claim rules that Beth was showing earlier, you know, the files, the claim rules that Beth was showing earlier against what we have in our system to see, you know, what direction we want to go if any changes need to be made or anything. Okay. So, we can just send that up sooner than later then. I wouldn't. Now, do you guys do contract billing? For if contracted payers? Yeah. So, for example, Medicaid, right? We're given set pricing based on the state, but Medicaid would only reimburse us a certain price. So, the price that we have in the system, for example, is $300 because Medicaid will, let's say Medicaid will only pay $200. If you bill Medicaid $100, they're only going to pay $100. If you bill Medicaid $300, they will pay you $200. So, you know, we do have contracts and, you know, we've stopped, we've gone off and on on whether or not we continue to use them based on how much work it is to keep it up to date. But we do like it where if you bill Medicaid, it will automatically adjust to the $100 and bill whatever the Medicaid rate is for that time. Would that be a billing rule? No, we do have contracted rates available and we can go over those when we get to that point in the implementation. And is that contracted rates based on fiscal year changes? Yeah, well, they do six months pretty much. They do fiscal year and they do sometimes do a January change as well. But the doctor club team will have all of that. We don't have to keep track of most of that stuff. I think that's always the annoying part too. Well, I'll let them verify that question. Do you guys monitor and update the contract rates? No, we don't. Right. We just make them available for you. And is that a manual upload or can we upload based on a spreadsheet? Or is that a manual change? No, it's a manual change. But then once you change the first one, it's easy to import into the other payers. So it's only one set of rates need to be entered and then the rest of them can just be imported. Well, I guess we'll have to see what it looks like. I think it's okay. I feel like whatever data and however the state communicates the data with us, I'm trying to figure out if there's a way for it to be communicated and just uploaded into the system. But I guess not really. All right. No problem. I was thinking about something a little bit more. Some places have a place where you can put into an Excel spreadsheet to upload. Right. So for example, NexGen does have that. We don't have that service, which is why we struggle to keep, which is why the county does not always keep contracts up because it can be a lot of manual, tedious work updating those. Right. And it doesn't affect payment. It just makes some of the reporting a little cleaner, if that kind of makes sense. So that's why I was asking what their function was and we're resetting that up in the implementation or not, if they had the functionality. So. Okay. One question we do have, are you guys are billing for dental services? We are. Yes. Okay. So we'll need to make sure we have all the ADA claim stuff installed then. Yes. I still do what we need to do for dental. There's still this, I still have to figure something else out for dental. I just want to put that out there. Amy, did you have any other questions on that? Software. Yeah, I do. I see there's a hand raised. You want to, I don't know. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Nothing. I just wanted to add on to what you just said. So I did send an email out, we need to talk about dental separately, but we also need to kind of start talking to Dentrix about the integration, whatever the county finalizes with them. We need to start talking about that if we could. That is on my plate. So yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Yeah. For continuing with the dental services. Yeah. We need to set up a system to support that. Yes. But in general, have you interfaced with Dentrix before? It's not an unpopular dental software. No, we have not. Well, you have not. No. Okay. Yeah. I should have you have some information this week. Okay. Very good. Yes. And then another question I have. So we use the sliding fee scale, ability to pay scale. Mm-hmm. I think in one of our first meetings, we were being, from what I heard, right, and correct me if I heard any of this incorrectly. I just need to know what I need to put into this spreadsheet. You guys don't have an ability to pay scale set up inside of the Dr. Cloud. Is that correct? No, we do. We use the contracted rates for the sliding fee scales, and then we just, we can have a setting that we adjust the charge based on the payer type or the payer setting. Right. So when I say ability to pay scale, I'm referring to self-pay patients only? Yes. Yep. Okay. So once somebody, so, and maybe it's easier, can we do a quick walkthrough of that, Beth? Can you walk through it and put you on the spot again, Beth? Yeah. I'll pay you back later. Thank you. So just, I'm trying to figure out how I set this up because I think you guys were saying I need to create a payer for each discount. Correct. Yeah. Each percentage. So pretty much I need to add, and then we have some that are zero, and then we have some that are flat fee that are just $5. So I need to create a payer for those as well? Yes. So. And then you're still preparing to show, right, Beth? I'm working on it. It's going to take a second. Okay. Just making sure. Sorry. So it's not done by income in your guys' system. Is that what I'm hearing? Correct. Well, the income then determines which sliding fee scale to enroll them in. So let me ask the question a different way. We have a sliding fee functionality around income and household size. We have a spreadsheet. I'm supposed to share this spreadsheet with you. The problem with sharing that spreadsheet is I have the version that somebody tinkered with. Not necessarily that it's not. It's like they're looking at the codes and stuff like that. And actually, I'm going to share it in the chat here. I assume that could be built in your system and everything else fall in line. That is my assumption, but then I tend to go a little crazy. But there's a functionality behind the actual sliding fee scale based on household size and income, and I assume you can build something like this that then will populate in the billing site. Yay name. So we'd have to look at it. Okay. While Beth is bringing that up, let me show you the spreadsheet because Beth is not going to bring this up. She's going to bring up something else, and I have it. I'll show it real quick. Yeah, I just have to build it really quick in anticipation. I'm getting there. Give me two minutes. And if you want the original, we can send you the original spreadsheet from the state. Pop the original spreadsheet in here for me real quick, Tello, because that's what I wanted to show the Dr. Cloud team. So I wasn't ready for that. I may be to pull it real quick. Let me see. How do you like being put on the spot? Yeah. Hey, you're getting back for Beth. Yes. Open link. No, I'm using, you know, I'm using the one that we've been doing our mad math in for the social service side. But if you pop yours in the chat while Beth is doing that, and I can get this up on the screen. So this is what it looks like, guys. Can you see my screen real quick? No? Yes. Okay. Is it large enough? That's fine for me. Is it hard to read? Is it a little bigger now? Yes. Looks good to me. Okay. Oh, sorry. I said hard to read. I'm trying to get to the top of this page. Okay. So this is what the front part of the spreadsheet looks like, right? And let me do this opening desktop because I think the desktop is much better than this thing here. And I think that's why it looks odd. Give me a second, guys. I'm just going to share the desktop version. Stop sharing. And share. No. You need to pay. All right. Is that a little better? I'm sorry. I wasn't seeing my scroll bars because I'm on the web version. So do I need to make it less? No, that's good. Okay. So the household size correlates with the income and pay information, right? Some of them are flat fee and some of them are a percentage over a certain line. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So this is what we get from the state. And every year we get this? Yes. Calendar year, right? Not fiscal. Yes. Yeah. So we get it every January. We have to update this. But what I'm saying is this information then influenced the billing piece on the self-pay. I was wondering if you could build this is what I'm saying. Is there anywhere in your system to build this thing? Well, is each of the tiers... I mean, it looks like they're no more granular than 5%, right? So the $5 is a flat fee? Yep. And then there's 10%, 20%, but there's also 35, 40, 45, 50, so on and so forth. There's also a minimum. So if you're of the 5%, you pay a minimum of $8. So that's where the other catch is going to be, right? In creating a payer. I can put 5%, but if their charge ends up being, let's say they're 5% and their charge ends up being, let's say a $40 immunization shot, that 5%, they wouldn't pay $8. They wouldn't necessarily pay 5%. Does that kind of make sense? I'm ready if you want me to demonstrate. But I think we can build that into the code is what I'm saying. I'm trying to figure out if there's any way to code this in. No, if they build this, what you're asking for, then we're fine. But right now it's not built, so we would have to do individual payers. And if we do individual payers, I guess then you do an individual rule for that, which now is a lot of... Yeah, I don't want to do it that way, Taylon. I don't either. That's why I was clarifying, because that's part of the spreadsheet. It determines how we put our payers and rules on that spreadsheet as well that we're doing now. Can I take the screen real quick? Sure. It's like we're running up against the other meetings. Oh, it's one o'clock now. I didn't even realize. But if we can get five minutes to share what you want to share, Beth, that's five minutes. And Neil, Ryan, we can share the sheet with you. Okay. Yeah. This is something that we definitely need, because it's not just... We use it across our services, right? And it's getting very complicated right now. And by rule, we also, by policy, we have to start charging these. So it needs to really be in the system. I'm not sure I'm allowed to put anything in the chat, because it's not letting me drag or drop or copy and paste. Yeah, I wouldn't either. I couldn't either. Put it in the folder. Yeah. Or send it to me, and then we can put it in the folder. Okay. Sounds good. Great. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you all. See you on the next one. Bye. So... Okay. So I'm hanging up. Yeah. So I think... Okay. We'll show them the next time, but send me the information, and I'll put it in the folder if you can't put anything in. I will also add, I don't think there is a next time. So should we just show them tomorrow at the Tuesday meeting? We can. Let's just show them that real quick, and then we can move to just making the work work, because I don't want to turn on this anymore. But in the folder, you're going to create a fiscal folder, right? There is a fiscal folder already. Okay. Let's upload whatever we need to share with them, including this thing and bed stuff in that same folder. Okay. Yeah, we'll do. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Bye.",
