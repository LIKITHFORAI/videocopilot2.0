  "text": "Yeah. What this means is there are fields here that are not complete. As an example, we run reports on a lot of these demographics. Let me just pull up another chart. This is mail test. Because I'm using a Sunday, just for privacy purposes, you are not going to see a colored in screen and I have to select my own service location, but that's not the case when it's an established schedule. Here on the details, we actually enter stuff. You can run a report on that as well, but we enter things like called client to confirm appointment, and then we add our initials, stuff like that. We use this actually quite a bit. You say, okay. Now I'm going to check this patient in. This is just our encounter screen. You can see what I entered in the details follows through here. I'll show you how you can see that in the EHR as well. This is our opportunity to change anything here. Like I said, we run reports on a lot of these things. These are basic demographics, but some not so basic. We run reports on sexual orientation, client identity, birth sex. We run reports on country of origin. I don't know if you saw this, but ethnicity, race, language. We run reports on homeless status, language, veteran status, that kind of stuff. Okay. Let me just auto-flow through here. Privacy notice. We do not enter a default rendering provider. And then here we do insurance. So for our purposes here, I'm not going to add an insurance. In our clinic, we really only see patients that are uninsured or that have medical assistance. So because I created a batch, this is a new screen that you'll see. So programs that don't collect money don't see this screen. I'm going to add money, and then I'm going to reach out to you. I'm going to add money, and then I'm going to reach out to finance later and ask them to remove it, just so you can see, because otherwise you may not get the gist of it. So I'm going to show you a section in the client's chart on this PM side where we document what the clinic fee is and eligibility and that kind of stuff. Usually the front desk is checking this. There is no spot, so we kind of usurped another spot, and we use it for our purposes there. So I'm just going to say $5 and cash. So if I auto-flow here, it's going to ask me if I want to apply this to the encounter or to the account. It's always the encounter, and you'll see why afterwards. But this is the patient's chart on the PM side, which is basically what the front desk sees. But you'll see a lot of billing. These are encounters. Under clinical history and notes, we go to chart notes. This is where we'll document what a client's clinic fee is, what their eligibility is, who their medical case manager is, who their nurse is, who their doctor is. We cannot run reports on this, so we actually also have to keep a separate Excel spreadsheet. But we also have to EVS our patients or check EVS, and there's no way to do it in the system. There used to be, but even when there was, in order to go through NextGen to check whether they had medical assistance, we had to have the medical assistance number. But with going straight through to EVS ourselves, because we all have web access, we can just put in the social security number and the client's last name, and we can get the same information. We couldn't do that through NextGen, so I'm hoping there's a way to do that in Dr. Cloud. So this is all manual entry right here. So as an example, I would click new, click note, and then I'm just going to add the same thing. Made up is our prescription drug assistance program, which is not available in our list of insurances because our list of insurances is for medical insurance. So this is our only way of tracking that. So you've got to enter anything in the red field, so I'm just going to add that, and there's that. So what the front desk person can do is once this is scheduled, when they're here, you can go into notes and access the same notes that I just put in. I can even put in a note through here also, but they would look and see, okay, the client's clinic fee is. They're eligible until, so then we're good to go. So that's how they know how much they charge the client. We have a nominal fee billing, so basically anyone 100% below the federal poverty level pays zero, and anyone between 101 and 500% of the federal poverty level pays $5. There's an additional. Sorry, so you use a sliding fee scale? Yeah, so we do. We do have a sliding fee scale, and it's mainly based around what our grant is. So our Ryan White HIV grant basically says any patient 100% below the federal poverty level cannot pay anything. So the sliding fee scale that's built into NextGen does not allow for that. It forces you to charge the client $5. Right, because it's the other sliding fee scale. All right, so I wanted to, so Diana, Jamila, let's make sure we have that as a point for them, that this program uses a completely different sliding fee scale based on grant. Right, because the other one that we build is for dental and everybody else. I think that's the one that's in NextGen. Thank you. Thank you, Joanne. Yeah, sure. Okay. So then now I'm going to go to the EHR. Joanne, sorry, just one other question. Is this fee based on the grant yearly? So once we get the, okay, all right. So we can build it and know that it's there for you guys as well. Yeah, so ideally what happens is we check a patient's eligibility every six months. So at the year, so initially they give us all their eligibility information, and we have a separate form for that, which I think we may have sent in, but I can pull it up and show you. So we have a separate form for that. At the six-month mark, we can do a self-attestation form. So if they attest to us that nothing has changed in the past six months, we have them sign it and we keep going. When they complete their first full year with us, then we request new proof of address, proof of income, an ID if they have it. Some of our clients do not. So we work on helping them get that. So those are kind of the basic eligibilities. That is outside of NextGen, right? Yes, that is outside of NextGen. So there's forms we complete that we sign, some of them the clients even sign, and they get scanned into NextGen. All right, if you can send me those forms if I don't have them already for your program. And this eligibility information, does it live anywhere in NextGen? Do you put the income anywhere in NextGen? No, we don't. There is a way that you can, but we share sometimes clients with behavioral health and sometimes they have different incomes than we do. I'm not exactly sure how they'll calculate their income. So for us, and this is grant-based, this is Ryan White-based, so it gets a little confusing. There are two incomes that we look at. We look at overall household income to make sure that the client qualifies for Ryan White benefits, and then we look at the client's individual income and that's what we base the clinic fee on. And that's not an us thing, that's a grant thing. So, yeah, and so it's a little confusing to be able to add it in, in the fields that are available in NextGen. I see, okay, thank you. So this is basically our intake form that you can see. A lot of this is so that a chart can be created in NextGen, but some of this isn't available in NextGen that are data points that we need. So I can send this to you. Okay, Neil, since you're here, one of the things I wanted to ask about the client side, can it be modified based on the data the program need, or it's just a generic intake that goes through the client portal? Actually, you could do quite a bit of customization on the fields that are available for like registration and stuff. There's actually a piece in the requirements document specifically for that where you can rename fields and do all that kind of stuff. So, yeah, there's a bit of fluidity in there. And it can be assigned by program initiated? If I'm a client and I am here for HIV, and HIV asks five things, can I fill that out for HIV? And then if I'm the same client for a different program and they ask a sixth thing, can I get the sixth thing? Like how dynamic is the client portal where you have integrated services? And you don't, Neil, you don't have to answer that. Can you talk specifically about the client portal, the patient portal? Yeah, the patient portal, I'm sorry, patient portal, right? So all the intake, what we have in Montgomery County is that each program might ask a different question, but some of them are the same, right? Yeah. And I was wondering if on the intake, we can trigger additional questions, not that the client answering the same question on intake all the time by program. I actually haven't done setup in patient portal yet. So let me check with Chris. I don't want to give you a bad answer on that. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. So I'll take that as an action item to find out. Sure. Jamila? Yes, I just have a quick question. So, Joanne, in terms of the forms that you scan in, would it be helpful to have some of that information in NextGen instead of scanning it in? I'm just saying in terms of would any of that – Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah, 100%. So that's a wish list. Okay. If it's in NextGen or if it's in the new EHR, then I'm going to – and I'm also going to hope that it is something that I can run a report on. Yes. Because that's – otherwise, then sure, it's fine if it's in there, but it does me no good if I still need to manually go into each and every chart to kind of pull this information or have a separate Excel spreadsheet that holds this information for me. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll note that as well. So that would be good. So then, like you said, you have to do reporting on ethnicity, race, gender, and various reports for – okay. Okay. That makes sense. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then Melvin? I was going to say Melvin. Quick comment. And then, Joanne, I think I know the answer to this. How often do you have to go into client charts to get the information that you need for reporting? So often. I mean, we have monthly reports that we have to do that are based on the clients that we've seen for that month, and then we have quarterly reports, six-month reports. We have our big end-of-the-year Ryan White Services report that is due in March for this past calendar year. So all these reports, a lot of this data gets pulled out into an Excel spreadsheet, and then it gets uploaded or manually entered by myself into another program called CareWare. And that's where we create our Ryan White Services report. So in that system, I can run and see what's missing, what data is missing, what I haven't entered, and then that means I have to go into each individual chart to pull that data. Sometimes it's data that I can't pull in a report. Sometimes it is, and I can run a report and figure it out that way. So this would be huge if we were able to do that. Yes, it would be. You and I talked about if there are certain fields that – I know that the county has certain fields that are mandatory, but if we could have the option to add fields that you could run reports on, that would also be really helpful. And I know that question was already asked, but just to restate that. Yeah. Yeah, so Diana, Jamila, I think I just need to meet with Joanne around the requirements around the Ryan White contract because I also think we should be doing some kind of system interface. This whole thing where we're doing two uploads is probably not appropriate. The other thing that we're going to be looking into, Joanne, is most of this information is going to come from the customer. So we're trying to push this back on the customer to update and send in. So even if we have the fields, that's appropriate, but I want the customer to be able to send this in because it makes no sense to have the fields and our staff is reentering that data from a piece of paper up into the system, honestly. So we're going to try to see if we can move a lot of this to the patient portal. Yeah. So if that's the goal, what language capabilities are we going to have? Because we have a ton of clients that are not English speaking. So I think that was in the RFP, Joanne, that the patient portal should be capable of at least the seven languages in Montgomery County. I will confirm that, which means that probably our go live on the patient portal will probably have maybe two languages and we have to do the others later because we probably won't get all seven in July. Right. Because someone has to do that translation of everything and validation. But I think the basic ones should be there, probably English, Spanish, French. But I will confirm with the Dr. Cloutin. But that was in the RFP as the capability. OK. Great. That would be great. OK. So in the EHR, the provider would either know that the client is here because the front desk would have called, told the nurse, or they can go into their appointment screen. I see a bunch of providers here, but really they would be set up to just see theirs. So here's my. I'm not going to show you the rest of that. But they can also come in here and look for the client. OK. So these are alerts. You had mentioned that in a previous one that I was in. So there are two types of alerts. There is a system alert on the PM side, which is, again, what front desk can trigger. That usually has a lot to do with clinic fees, name alerts, that kind of stuff. This is the patient alert on the PM side. You can manually enter that and I can show you afterwards. But this is here. So these are alerts. A lot of them are pre-populated, but you can also, I think, enter your own. So these are alerts that are available. And this is only seen on the EHR side, on the medical side. So our front desk team would not see any of these alerts that are popping up. Just like our clinical medical team would not see any five dollar clinic fee alerts that you see on the front end. So this is an encounter that was already created, which means it's a billable encounter. Even if you don't bill, you have to put in a CPT code and a diagnosis code, even if it gets sent nowhere. So when you hit this new button, you create a strictly clinical encounter, which means you don't have to enter anything. You can do, you know, you don't have to reconcile that encounter. So I thought I saw somebody's hand up. Never mind. So the doctors would go to their template. So we have a couple of templates that we use on the medical side. You have got your history and physical, which is obviously what it says. That's our big one. It's an hour long. Doctors go through everything. And then you have the regular sort of follow up or urgent sick visits. Right. So here. I'm going to put internal medicine because there is no infectious disease. It'd be great if there there was or I don't know if Dr. Cloud has these specifics. So internal medicine. And this would be an office visit. So usually the nurse starts off. So the nurse would come in. They would enter vitals. They would add or if there's medication on here because the client, even though they're new to us, maybe they're being seen in behavioral health or maybe they were seen by us 10 years ago and there's medication in here. They may reconcile that and they may also add allergies. So once they do that, then the nurse would go to documents and they would look for a nurse visit document. A nurse note. Nurse master. That's what it is. And they would generate this nurse master document, which is a blank document. Usually if it's a new patient, otherwise they would remove this. And then the nurse enters basic information, new patient, whether they use an interpreter, if the patient is with someone, any significant vitals or anything like that. Now, they're obviously talking to the doctor first and letting the doctor know all these things. They're not waiting for the doctor to come in and read the note. So they're kind of going through a lot of that. So when the doctor comes in, this is already done and generated. And the doctor comes in and would start off with histories. So they would add the problem list, which is basically the diagnosis. They would enter any sort of medical information. These are a lot of basics. We go through social history. We do confidential social history as well, which kind of goes into alcohol and drug. This is part of our grant. This is something we have to do. Any psychiatric history, any abuse incarceration, any STIs. So they would go through a lot of that. When they get to their SOAP note, they would then generate an HPI. So as an example, if it's an initial, it would click here. This is. They don't do anything on that. This is old. I don't know if you can see this, but this is very old. It's defining criteria. So a lot of this stuff is kind of outdated. So I don't really enter stuff here. Basically, they would add more comments on here. I want to pull up another one so you can see. Let's see. There are other HP eyes here. This HIV follow up. I'm trying to find one that has. There's a part here that has something that's called my phrases, which are phrases that the doctors do preemptively. And you can pull that up so that let's see. So that all they have to do is fill fill things in. OK, here's one. So you see here, this is my phrases. I don't have one. This is this is actually practice, but this will be good. This is for this is something that was created prior. Right. Chief complaint. These are basic questions that I need to remember to ask if I'm the NP or the doctor. And if I insert and close in here, all I have to do is then add numbers, let's say. And then I've got it all here. Right. So this way, the doctors don't have to remember. Wait, did I ask about site exposure? Did I ask about this? Did I ask about that? It's kind of a shortcut. I believe most EHRs have this, but it's definitely something that we use across the board with our HIV medical staff and our STI medical staff. Then after that, again, they go through history. If you click on here, you can go into different. This will open up different screens. You can see here. So there are different screens that this will kind of open up tobacco history and all that sort of stuff. Then they do their review of systems. And I can't even pretend to know what exactly they go through with all that. The vital signs should already be there. This is the physical exam. They can go through this one pager or they can go through specific, specific, I guess, areas. Then we get to their assessment and plan. So here you've got the diagnosis. A lot of our providers have favorites that they've already done. You can name it. For example, this one's mine. And I can say, OK, this is one of the diagnoses that I use a lot. So I don't have to search through, for example, this client all the way to find HIV somewhere around here. I've already got it in my favorites. Then I go to my plan. Do it real quick. I think this is for the cloud team. Is that something that can figure out by program? In the system. Instead of having a long list that often use diagnoses, you know. There is some configuration, but take a look at it. OK, perfect. Thank you. Yeah, because there's obviously different diagnoses. But for the most part, every single one of our patients is going to have an HIV diagnosis. So here, same thing, if you can see here, my phrases. This is also, you know, set up. I think I have one set up now. But if I did, you would see it here and it would populate there. But basically we would put in the patient plan and the patient plan consists of every single diagnosis. Right. Usually there isn't just one. So you'll have the HIV diagnosis. You will have, I don't know, let's say diabetes and syphilis. So the plan would then pull up each diagnosis and you could add your phrases there. Again, mine is not set up for that, but that's where you would see it. If the doctor wants to order labs, they can do it through here. This is kind of a limited screen, so they usually don't. I can show you how we do labs, though. This is you don't do anything here. We also do not use this referrals. It's it's quite limited and it very rarely will go or is connected to places that we send our clients. So don't use that. This office procedures, we use this if we're going to do an actual procedure here, which at this point is only when we're giving Cabanuva shots, which are HIV medication shots. And we have a very limited number of clients that we do that for. But you can see here, these are kind of the different. Different, I guess, shots that we have here, apertude and things like that. So. Let me go to close, save and close. And then obviously patient plan would all be here. And then at that point, the doctors would usually go to the labs. So these are labs that they can do. We. We work with three different labs and we also have in-house. So we have State Quest and LabCorp and we have in-house labs. This was set up for us so that, as an example, these are the in-house labs that we do that are connected to our program. Different programs will have different in-house labs. LabCorp. Same thing. These. This is what we are contracted to be able to send to LabCorp. We wouldn't be able to send anything else. Same thing with Quest. And then the state. Right. So I'm just going to show one. Here I would look for the HIV diagnosis. I don't see it, so I'll just do search all. Here's my favorites as well. OK, so here's my HIV diagnosis. And if I'm the doctor, I've done this and then I hit save. And then the lab tech comes in, opens this back up, goes to test details, clicks on when they've done it, and then we'll add serum. And usually we'll save and send. Right. And then for our purposes, I'm just going to save it. Now we can enter information. We can enter results here manually. I believe most EHRs have that feature, but usually we get things in electronically. Now, there are plenty of times where we have issues with our interface where the state is sending us electronic results, but it's not coming in or whatever. So, you know, we'll get those labs and we will scan it in. But it's not something that I can pull up in a report. It's not something that is in a grid. So we try to also manually add it. So in this case, I've got the HIV viral load here. I'm going to do new results entry. And then you have to know what the component is called. But in our case, it's called HIV1 RNA. And then the results. This pops up automatically, but if it doesn't, because sometimes it doesn't, you can click on the date and the collection time. And then you can save. And then now the results are here. This is something that I can print for the patient, but it's also something that now goes into their results grid. Here it is. As opposed to going to the patient's chart, clicking on scan documents that some patients have dozens. And as you can see, these we can't call the document whatever we want. There are predetermined document names that we can use. And so really, we have HIV confirmatory and then we have other lab results. That's it. So this could contain if it's, you know, a longstanding patient, it could contain a ton of them. So like I said, this is why we like to add it here, because also when I do a report on these results, I can pull this in my report. I can't pull anything that's been scanned in into my report. Then once all that's done. I think immunizations, we do that too. It's done through here as well. It's it's actually nothing new. I feel like you've seen that. Let me show you how we do medications. So the doctor would come here. They would prescribe new and you just have to start entering. And usually you've got to enter the brand name, not necessarily the medication name, if that makes sense. So this is Biktarvy. Obviously, the doctor would know which one they want. You double click. It'll give you based on the diagnosis, it'll give you any sort of, you know, drug interactions. You as the doctor need to acknowledge and then you select. You've got to complete all the red fields. So start date. You have to have a stop date. So let's do 30th. And then you have to have a diagnosis that you add. There's the diagnosis. I hope that's not a real pharmacy. I can look up a different pharmacy if the client needs to. These are. There's a list in our file maintenance that that I believe I.T. gets to update. But just accept this. I really hope that's not a real pharmacy. It's asking me if I want to create a new encounter for this. No. OK, so now it's right here and it's on the list of medications that the client has. If this actually went to a pharmacy, this dispense history would be available. It wouldn't be grayed out. And then I could see which pharmacy it went to, when it was sent, and how many refills and stuff like that that the patient has. So when all that's done, I would go, me as the doctor, I would go to finalize after the lab tech, after everything's done, immunizations have been given, labs have been done, all that sort of stuff. Then I would come here. My diagnosis is already there. And then I can check off my CPT code. And I would submit the code. It says that. And then the master IM gets created, which is basically everything that was completed and filled out based on this appointment. There may be extras, and I'm able to delete or keep things. So let's say I don't want to have that. I can just delete it. Let's say I don't want to have this list here. I can delete it. And then you can see that I'm the provider, and when I generated, save it. So then I'm done. The front desk would pick up from there. So at that point, the front desk would come in, and they would begin the checkout process. So again, no insurance. So this is telling me there's a charge in the EHR, and do I want to kind of bring it over to the PM site? So I would process it. Now it's asking me there's $5. There's a $5 credit on this encounter. Do I want to utilize it? So obviously the answer is yes. Then the rest of this, I have to adjust out. So I would create a transaction. And then here, this is how much the charge is. This is the balance. So I would go here and mirror what this balance is. You hit recalc, and then now the balance is zero. And here I can determine what my adjustment code is. So our adjustment is always program adjustment. We've been told by finance we can use courtesy adjustment as well. This isn't something we can pull reports on. So it's something on the finance side. But for our purposes, I'm going to do program adjustment. And then you would hit save. And then I can close out of this. Now in my batch, I go to my ledger. So this is the transaction that just happened. So now it's the end of the week. I would be doing this for every single patient. If the patient didn't pay, I'm still going through this whole process, and I'm adjusting out the full amount because we don't send bills to the patient. They don't carry a balance. It's part of our grant. So if they pay their $5, great. If they don't have to pay money, great too. We adjust everything out. So in order to send this to finance now, I've got to reconcile this. So I would basically look at what was billed, allowed payment. The payment part is the main part. This is what finance is going to, I guess, verify. So I would copy what's on here, as long as everything is correct, and the main thing is the payment part. So if at the end of the week what I'm depositing to the bank is $5, then that is the deposit slip that I am giving finance when I upload all this information to SharePoint. I'm not going to do that because I wouldn't be able to delete this if I could. And then once I do that, this will say balance. Right now it says out of balance. And then once I can do that, this is grayed out because it won't let me post an out of balance. But once I post this, it is a form, like a PDF, that gets generated that then has everything that I've adjusted and how much money I've collected. And that then gets sent with some other paperwork to finance. That's pretty much it. I tried to narrow it down as much as I could. I feel like I could go into so much more detail, but I don't want to overwhelm everybody. No, this was very helpful. Neil, any questions from your side? It's actually pretty thorough. So, Joanne, in terms of managing this program, do you have any spreadsheets that you use? So, really, we only have two spreadsheets. We've got one that is so we can monitor caseloads. So this will tell us who, you know, we have two doctors, who Dr. Bebe is seeing, who Dr. Rosen is seeing, what nurse is assigned to that client, what social worker is assigned to that client. Or if they don't have a social worker, what case manager is assigned to that client. There's no way to get that in NextGen. We used to try to add it here. Let me show you. But a social worker is on the case management side in NextGen? Yes. When you say social worker, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And so we used to try and add it here. I think we had to add it as a task. But that just got, it just, it got very muddled because finance uses this field for completely different reasons. And it just, it just got very muddled. It was the only way we could pull a report. So then we stopped doing that. So we have a separate spreadsheet for that. So really a lot of it just comes from the reports that we do. So I have reports that we do, that I do on the practice management side, which is a lot of demographics, appointments, anything that you can see, program revenue, whether it's through insurance or whether it's through actual payments and that kind of stuff. So we pull, I pull a lot of those reports on this side. On the EHR side, there's a different set of reports I can pull. I can pull template-specific reports. We have a template that was created for us on the case management side that I use that the only way to pull reports from there is to pull based on specific fields. I have reports based on lab results, right? I need to know CD4 count and viral load. I need to know syphilis results. I need to know QFT, which is TB stuff, tobacco usage. I don't use that very much. Hepatitis. So I'll pull reports that way. What I am limited on, which would be great if this was different. Let me see. Can I show you this? Okay. So this right here, I'm not going to show you. I narrow it down based on physician, because if not, I would get every HIV report across NextGen, which means I could potentially get reports from school-based health centers. We only see adults in our clinic, so you've got to find a way to narrow it down. So I use either our doctors or I use our location to narrow it down. You can select the labs that you want, but here, results, I'm limited to only four results. If I'm looking at state lab, Quest, and LabCorp, they name their results differently. So HIV viral load is named different in LabCorp. It's called something slightly different through the state, and it's called something slightly different through Quest. So I'm limited. So sometimes I have to run multiple reports, and I just single out the lab. And I have to know what it's called in that lab so that I can single it out, because otherwise, this is the potential of results that I have to look through, right? Okay. So this question is for Neil. Is there any common language crosswalk? Is this the same thing that we were talking about before in the other meeting regarding common language among ... Okay. So Joanne, we're going to try to see if we can do some ... make it a little easier for you. We're not sure how, right? Yes, exactly. But you're not the only one encountering this problem right now. And so let me show you, when I said template-specific report, let me show you kind of how we have to do that. So go here. This was a template that was created for us by NextGen. Some of it's outdated, because NextGen has kind of, you know, I guess, evolved. So as an example, before, when this was created 10 years ago, there was no birth sex. So we had a field here. Now I can just pull it from here a lot easier. But in order to pull these, I have to go to ... I have to find the field name, right? And so I don't know if you can see that, but that's the field name. So if I'm looking at a template report, and these are reports that I created. You can start from scratch, but these I've already sort of saved. But I would have to go to the template, and then I'd have to check off the boxes that I need based on what the field names are. So let me show you what one of these looks like. I'm just going to remove the client name, and the date of birth. Okay. And here I can adjust the date. Yep, and it always kicks me back here, so I have to ... Hi, this is Charisse. I just wanted to mention that this isn't a NextGen. This wasn't created by NextGen. I just wanted to let Neil know that. If you notice in the upper left corner, it has HHS. So that's one of the internal templates that was done by an internal contractor. So, but you all do have that on the list that IT provided to you as a template. So I'm just going to go ahead and show you that. So this is kind of what I get, and then I export it out into an Excel spreadsheet, and then I can actually go through it. Because what you don't see, because I removed the names, is there's a ton of duplicates. I don't understand why. I've tried to narrow it down as much as I can, so there aren't as many duplicates. But I can see that there's a ton of duplicates, and I can see that there's a ton of duplicates. I've tried to narrow it down as much as I can, so there aren't as many duplicates. But there are a ton. So basically, I'll pull this out into, I'll export it into Excel, and then I'll go ahead and start kind of removing things, adding things, all that sort of stuff. Like this right here, I change it into an actual date. This has month, day, and year. Yeah. So, Joanne, you haven't found any difference in what's causing the duplications? No, we tried, but we're not sure. I think the reason is because we did not pay for the reporting system, and they are using the basic CAIN report. We are also encountering the same issue when we are working denials. The insurance company will give us, let's say, three denial reasons, right? So those three denial reasons under my visit, it will show like I was here three times, because the dollar amount will show three times, you know, like $100, $100, $100. And if I try to filter it out by name and just leave my name once, then it will then lead the denial reason. If I try to filter it through the denial reason, then it will delete the way that I can actually work those denials. But if I don't do anything, the dollar amount will inflate so much that you will see a number that is not realistic, you know, because it's the same visit, just three or four times under the same patient. Yeah. So I don't know if you can see this. I removed the names, but you can see the dates of birth are the same, maybe not that one. But there's a few that the date of birth is the same. I can't seem to remove the ones that are blank. I've tried many ways. So this is a viral log report. So this, again, I would just have to export into an Excel spreadsheet and then remove and delete whatever I needed to. Okay. And the stuff that had to be scanned in, you would have to just manually enter it into an Excel spreadsheet. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. I got it. Yeah. Just a quick, I guess just a quick comment. This is Melvin. Joanne, I know that you and I had a conversation about this, but the number of reports that you have to run every single month, I know that it's a concern was being able on day one of you being able to run the reports that you need to run for the grants that need to be submitted. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know exactly how the transition is going to go, but let's say as an example, July 1, everything will be Dr. Cloud, right? So I need to get reports for June. I don't know if there's going to be a kind of a carryover, if there's going to be a next gen legacy site or something along those lines where I can still potentially run reports. Let's say as we have our grant come back to us a year later and say, give me numbers for 2023 and this is what I need. I need viral load, I need CD4 count, I need gender, I need country of origin, right? So I need to be able to access that information somewhere. I don't know if it's all going to be able to flow over into Dr. Cloud, but if not, that's definitely a concern. And then moving forward, let's say, again, with the same example, Dr. Cloud on day one, on July 1, then at the end of the month, the reports that I need to run, I want to make sure that I'm connected with somebody that can, from day one, kind of go over reports with me so I can practice and go through, you know, we have like 10 days, the first 10 days in August to get our reports together, to send it to our grant. So I don't want to struggle August 1st trying to figure things out because it's a lot. It's a lot of data and so, yeah, that's kind of my concern and I am a worrywart. So take that with a grain of salt. I think this was very, very helpful, Joanne. If you can send us any of those management spreadsheets and the reports that you have that you create, and I will share it with the Dr. Cloud team in our project folder. And also send me what is not in NextGen right now to help you manage, right? So send me that, saying like, okay, this is how we manage this program. Okay. All right. And do we want to set up a separate time then for the clinical social work side? I can do that. I was going to say, I can squeeze something in. Okay. I'll look at the calendar for the, and this would be HIV, the clinical side of the house. Okay. Yeah, you can do social work, whatever you want to call it. Okay. So we can add the fee schedule, but also the verification of insurance so that we can have it in the system. Yeah. Yeah. Because there are a ton of like physical paper documents that get signed on that side. Consent forms, client rights and responsibilities, our fee assessment, all sorts of things. Not just like a privacy notice here and there. So it would be great if some of those could already be implemented into Dr. Cloud somehow. Because our grant changes and sometimes the requirement changes, we also need to be able to change those forms. So there needs, ideally it'd be great if there was some sort of, you know, kind of leeway with that. I don't want something to be created and now it's set in stone and I can't change it or adjust it based on our grant needs. If you have those forms, send it to Arisha if you have those forms. Yeah, I sent everything over when we had our first meeting, but I mean, I can send it again. They're in the folder. They're in the folder. Okay. Diana, Jamila, I need to ask the risk and compliance people a question regarding the consent for service. Because HHS is a HIPAA-covered entity, does the client have to keep signing a consent for service for every single program? That's not how the programs exist. It only exists in their own isolation, right? And I feel like a lot of this stuff is overwhelming for customers because they keep signing the same paper for every single program, which is unnecessary. But I need to confirm that with the risk and compliance base. The good news is that even though we have individual programs, they are all registered under one tax ID for the entire Montgomery County. So that would be really good because we can list all of them under the agreement instead of like going side by side by side, you know, signing. Yes. I agree. This would be an agreement that needs to happen with our grant. Because when we get audited, they ask for it. Show me your consent for medical case management. Show me your patient consent form. Show me the signed grievance policy form and all that other stuff. And those were things that we didn't create. They were given to us. Right. But I think what Richon is saying is true, that we can combine everything in one place because it still will cover those areas. So we'll get you what you need for the grant. It's just that even the stuff that you need for the grant, other programs are asking the exact same thing to the same customer, right? So we want to make sure you have what you need, but we also have a very streamlined customer service space, especially if we're having the patient portal piece, right? That's the client going to do it through there anyway, and we want to make sure. But I will get back to you on that. Okay. And I wrote it down. So I guess I have a quick question for Neal. In Dr. Cloud, do you have these specific HIV, you know, like forms or templates, you know, because she mentioned they have to do like the, you know, the psychological, the alcohol drug, the RSR. Do you have specific templates in there for HIV? Actually, I believe so. I'll need to look at them. Okay. Okay. Okay. One sec. I'll see if I can just see them in. Okay. These templates came from NextGen or did we build them, Joanne? Do you remember? All of them came from NextGen with the exception of that RSR one. So then it probably is in Dr. Cloud then. In Dr. Cloud because it's still the compliance. Okay. I just wanted to. The only ones that I'm concerned about is the one that we actually quasi built. Like, so whatever. Yeah. The RSR template. Yeah. RSR. Okay. Which is needed. That's why you created it. Okay. Yeah. Exactly. So we have a template on the STI side, but those are the only two really that were created for us. Okay. The one on the STI side, I believe NextGen actually created because we paid for that. I see. Okay. Yeah. And I think the list that Cherie shared says the difference between the HHS created and the, so they'll have those. Okay. Perfect. Mm-hmm. Neil, you can get back to us with that. Yeah. The other question. Mm-hmm. No. Not for me. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you, John and Melvin. Thank you. And I'll set up that meeting. Thank you so much. Yep. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye. Thank you, guys. Bye-bye. Thank you all. Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
