  "text": "Angeline, we'll just wait. At this time, we were just told that we just need to put in the basic information since we're going to be making the changes, upcoming changes. We didn't need to put in a lot of information. So let us know when you're ready to share your screen. That's fine. Okay. Summer, while we wait for Angeline, can we put in the meeting or in the meeting invites that if someone just can become ready to share their next-gen screen, because probably this kind of didn't go over well. So most people seem like they don't know that's one of the requirements, although it was in there. I will. I will update the invite. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And, Angeline, let's see if you can send, what's in an email today around the expectation. Okay. Thank you. That's a next-gen. Okay. While we're waiting, I just want to catch Romesh up. He's our chief product officer and joining these calls as well. So Romesh, before you joined this Baby's Born Health Program, did not have a requirement to use next-gen until the first of this year, which is considered today. So they're going to walk us through what they know of the workflow, how the system is used, but there probably won't be a lot of data in there to share with us. So just a heads up, we should still ask, you know, questions and get clarification. Okay. Got it. That's so good. Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So I think one of the reasons for that, just to give you guys a little bit of background, the Baby's Born Healthy, Diana is here, and Jimmy is here, is not a billable location. They probably just use the case management for this. That's correct. Okay. Just... Okay. I'm just trying to find my next-gen page right now. We currently don't have a case management portal, and this is Diana, sorry, because I'm in two meetings, but we currently don't have a case management portal in next-gen, so that will be something that this program will definitely need, because they are doing like a workaround to be able to not trigger bills for services that are unbillable. I hope that makes sense, but I think that would be the most important part for this program, to have a case management section where they can actually do case management without triggering billing. Again, then... Ryan, Neil, Ramesh, that's the biggest piece with these folks, right? So they're probably trying to do some weird workaround so that it's not triggering. Yeah, it makes sense. I think we want to understand the requirements in the case management piece, but I think in our system, we can have locations that are not billable as a checkbox. Perfect. Usually, the services are set up as not billable, so whatever services these locations provide, John, you'll have to set them up as non-billable. So those encounters will be created as non-billable encounters. Perfect. This is Becky from School-Based Health Centers, and this would be similar to our teen pregnancy programs for the high school and middle schools as far as case management. That's all they do. They do not bill for those. Okay, I'm not getting in. I'm not getting in. Sorry. I don't know if I need to reset. That's fine. I think maybe we can call this one since they're not in, so it wouldn't be a part of the data transfer scope right now. Is that okay? Angeline, is there an SOP that you can share with us or any kind of write-up on what the information is and what the expectation around using NextGen? I mean, I don't have a write-up on it, but what I do have is a document form of the information that needs to be put in there, you know, such as the visits, the visits when there are, like the initial visit, the prenatal visits, like the second trimester, the third trimester, the postpartum visit, two weeks. So, I have a list of that, the two weeks, the one month, the third month, and the six month, and then we close it up. So, I have that. Those are usually events. Those are under the events, and then the documentation that needs to go under those particular events when the nurse scheduled the visit will be, you know, depending on what visit it is. It can be, I don't know, will it be like checks? Will it be, will they just check the? No, so you just, Angeline, you got cut off, but you will just tell us exactly what your expectation is, because right now for you, what we would do is, since there's no real data now, and we're in the throes of this, we would, the expectation from Dr. Claude will be built to what you need, right? So, it's not, if you, whatever information you share with us is, okay, this is what we need to do for our program. Okay, so yeah, I can send that. Okay, that will be very helpful. Dr. Claude, am I okay? Yeah, yeah, it'll be helpful, but, you know, on a high level, Richon and Angeline, what the workflow will look like is when, so either these appointments are set up or they're walk-ins. In Dr. Claude EHR, we will help you set up what we call calendar categories or appointment templates, and these appointments or calendar categories will be offered as services at, you know, we'll pick the locations where you provide these services, right? When we set up the appointment templates, we'll be setting them up as non-billable. It'll be attached to a workflow, and the workflow in Dr. Claude EHR is essentially, it's an ordered set of documents, so it's a prioritized list of documents, okay? And those documents will then, you know, when these patients or clients, when they get checked in, the system will start them off with that service and the documentation for that particular appointment, and so all services, you know, at all the different locations will sort of be structured in the same manner, so what we'll need to know is, you know, which are these appointment types or calendar categories that need to be set up, what locations they're offered at, and then what documentation, maybe it's just a case note that needs to be completed, and that's absolutely fine. We can connect the dots there, and then walk you through on what that workflow is going to look like, so. Okay, so what some of the, yeah, yeah, that's fine. That sounds good for when they come into the office, but most of them will be like home visits, so, yeah, so they'll be mostly like home visits. Okay, and so will they keep carrying a laptop or something like that that they go to these locations with, or? Well, they may be taking a laptop, or they may be taking a notepad and then come back later to put the information in a system, yeah. Yeah, and that can be done too, so. Yeah, okay, so who would I send this to? So, just send it, just send it to me, Anjani. Anything that you have, just send it. Dr. Cloud, Team Summer, I'll upload it to the same SharePoint site with the SOPs for each category, okay? Sure, sounds good. But I think we're good to go on this one. This one's easy, and you just let us know how we want to reach back to this program, since it's probably a new build. Will do, yeah. As we start building it out in the system, if we have questions, we'll circle back with you. Okay, so any information that we put in between now and whenever this cloud starts will be able to be transferred? Yes, I just need to see all the details, but you'll send that information to me, so I think we're good. Sounds good. Thank you, team. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much. We'll get some time back. Summer, I need that meeting for tomorrow. I sent you an email on that, just clarifying if we were talking about two different things or the same thing. Yeah, I'll respond. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right, thank you. Okay, bye. Summer and I haven't been able to reschedule the one for today at 2.30 because they are not answering me, the team members, so I guess we're going to have to keep it at 2.30. I apologize. Yeah, that's fine. We'll figure that one out. Thank you, guys. Bye. Bye, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you",
