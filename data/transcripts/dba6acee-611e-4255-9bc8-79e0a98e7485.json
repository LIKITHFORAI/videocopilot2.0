  "text": "Becky, who in your department is going to be showing the workflow? Dr. Cloud, they just need somebody who can walk them through the process from the time that you receive a referral, if that's the way that you receive your clients, or whatever other way that you receive the clients, just to show them what happens from step one to step two, and how you use the system so that they can see if what they currently have is what you need, or if they need to develop something that is going to be based on your needs. Sure. Not me, because I've been locked out of NextGen again. Rahel, or Angela, or Dabra, do you want to pull up NextGen and show, Rahel, maybe show what a visit would look like for you? Yeah, do you want to start from the part, are they able to show from the part when you are receiving a client referral? So, our client referrals come from via email, via fax, and then we have a shared spreadsheet with a pact called the patient log, and that has PHI on it, so we do have Dr. Cloud on the call, or is everybody here from internal DHHS? No, this is Dr. Cloud's call. Okay, so then we wouldn't be able to show that, but we can just say that we get our referrals from a spreadsheet, fax, or email. We do have a best patient, Angela. So, we have a BAA in place, folks, so if it's HIPAA related, it's okay to share, but you guys can confirm internally if you need to, but we have a business associate document in place. Correct, and Rishan is here as well. Okay. Yeah. All right. So, Rishan, or anybody, there's no reason why we can't show them our spreadsheet where we get our referrals. Can we please show them right now? We are sharing the spreadsheets with them because they are trying to build something for us, yes. It's not a problem, it's not a conflict, no. Okay. So, let me share my screen right now. As long as we try not to share patient information, you know what I mean? You can. It's going to be an empty form. Yeah, so just show, and if you can, just hide the column IDs, the patient IDs on the columns. It's a spreadsheet, right? Yeah. So, it's a spreadsheet that has the patient's name, date of birth, MA number, medical record number. Right, so hide all of that and show us the rest of the data. All of that what? All those columns? The identifiers, just to hide the identifiers. So, this is a live, okay, hold on, yeah, this is a live spreadsheet that people are actively working in. So, if I hide columns, it's going to, okay, let me see if I can download it and then hide columns. So, give me a second. As we're talking, it may not be completely essential to share it. When a woman gets pregnant and she goes and applies for Medicaid, the state then sends us her name, that she's a newly pregnant enrolled person. They send it to our team called the PACT or the ACCU. They then call the clients that we've been sent and put them on this spreadsheet and decide if that client needs a home visiting referral or not, and that's how that spreadsheet indicates yes or no and what program it should go to. So, that's the beginning of our process. It all really starts with the state and the state sends us everything still right now in another spreadsheet. So, it's a spreadsheet that we can't even copy or share. We have to retype everything from the state and put it on our spreadsheet. So, when Angela, for example, sees that a case has been, is on the spreadsheet that is going to the Silver Spring Health Center, I think that's where we can start right now. Angela, if you want to show what you do in NextGen when we have a case. Okay. So, before the chart even gets to the clinical staff, the admins have to either create the chart or to check in NextGen if the client already has an existing record. So, do you guys need to see the admin workflow as well or just clinicals today? I think everything. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'm hearing an echo. I can't. I couldn't hear. What was the answer? They say both. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. So, that spreadsheet or that email, whatever the demographics of the client that comes in, our admins go to patient and then they search up the client either by date of birth first, last name, first name, address. If it comes back no client found, then they go ahead and create the chart. So, let me. Okay. Then it comes to this screen. If the client doesn't have like MA or any known insurance, right now we've been putting in 9999 as our workaround, putting in the date of birth, the sex, all the demographics. For case management, we do not bill. So, we put in non-billable for the quote unquote like insurance. So, then when we do any encounter for the client that any charges attached to a phone call or a home visit will zero out at the end. So, this will take a lot of time, but all these red areas is where they have to fill in, putting in their education level, country of origin, HIPAA, their homeless status, all these red areas have to be filled out or the profile won't be created. And then Dr. Davis, her name has to be attached to this client so that any reportable encounters will fall under her and then also under Silver Spring. So, once everything is done, we save the profile. Angela. Yes. I'm sorry to interrupt you. When you say that you guys don't bill for the services, you are selecting uninsured or non-billable services? What did you say? We are putting in non-billable. Sometimes if the client is already existing, their MA information sometimes is already inside their chart. So, then whenever we are doing anything on the client, when we go to check out, we just make sure we pull back the insurance and then put the non-billable to the right so that the non-billable is what's going to zero out the charges after we document. Even if the visit is billable and they have an insurance, we are selecting non-billable, correct? Yes, because we do not bill Medicaid or any insurance for our home visiting services. Our visits aren't billable. Medicaid won't pay for our visits. Okay. So, that's it. So, now, so let's say I created this client or she has the existing chart. This is what her chart looks like. It has her name, all her demographics here at the top. You see that the non-billable is here. So, let's say I want to document that, you know, I've contacted the patient and she has agreed to a home visit. So, what I have to do is I go to new here and then I have to pick one of the templates. So, when I go to here, it pulls up all the templates that are available in NextGen. For quick notes, I do CM documentation. I select that and I come down to Peace Management Interactions and a lot of pop-ups is famous in NextGen. So, you have to keep clicking and then what I do here is then I will just write my, you know, note, you know, we'll see from all the, all the providers. Verify to client today at 10 p.m. Verify client, you know, program explained, client agreed to program. First initial visit scheduled for 1-16-26 at 10 a.m. So, I have to save this note, I have to close it, then I have to pick care management as the specialty, as the visit type, and then this pop-up again, case management again. Then I scroll down, hit case and consent summary, and then now this note populates on the side here and will also show here in like the, like the panel. And then now what, there are certain reports that we run here at the health center so that I as the manager can capture the time lapse between when someone from the PAC or the patient book is referred and then when they are open. And that is an initial telephone call. So, I'm going to ask Rahel, I'm going to stop sharing, she's going to pull up the same patient and then she's going to show you the EHR side and then what we do on the PM side to kind of bill for that telephone call so that when I run the report, I can see when the case was opened once it was referred. So, give us one second. Which is one of those, I think, back alley ways we figured out to get this report and that we would love Dr. Cloud to help us figure it out another way. So, when the client was assigned to a staff person as to when they opened up the case would be a report. And I have a list of some of the things we want that I can stick in the chat or I mean we'll come up with more as we go through. Yeah, you can put them in the chat, that'd be great. Hi, this is Rahel. Is everybody able to see my APM side of the NextGen screen with the schedule? Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you guys. So, I'm just going to do continue on with what Angela started with our test patient test Dobra. So, what the nurses would see when we're assigned a new case, it usually will be put in our calendar, usually after four o'clock to alert us it's a new client and will be bolded in black. So, I hypothetically, I'm going to see the client today. It's on my schedule. So, I'm going to show you the check-in process. And then once it's checked in, we're going to go to the EHR side where all the documentation will take place. Okay. So, I will be right-clicking here and I would go to check-in. This is for Angela to get a timestamp of how long it takes us to contact the client for any new referral. You choose yourself as the first consultant, whoever's seeing the client. Always choose non-billable. So, you just keep following the auto flow and make sure they're non-billable on both sides. Okay. So, this is our check-in process. Then I would go over to EHR where the charting would actually take place. And there's a clinical tasking side that shows every client that's been assigned to you. But if you want to be more specific about your daily appointments, you just click over to appointments. So, the test patient, excuse me, I'm on the wrong page. It's right here under testobra. Excuse me. And I'm going to add in what Angela showed, any new appointment you would add it. But because I checked in, it's already here. So, let me go here for a second. Okay. So, today's date is highlighted. I would select templates. And I would go to intake. So, I'm going to open a totally new record. And whenever we open any OB patient, our specialty is always OB or obstetrics. You go over to the visit type, and that's where the variation happens depending on what type of OB visit it is. So, for me, I'm going to pretend that I'm an OB patient. So, I'm going to go to OB visit. And I'm going to select the type of OB visit it is. So, for me, I'm going to pretend like it's a totally new client, an initial intake. And I'll click OK. So, this is our reason for the visit. Hypothetically, it's an orientation visit. It's the first time I'm meeting this client. So, I would just write my narrative here. First intake home visit with first-time mom, pregnant woman. Excuse my typos. So, that would just be a brief narrative. It would probably be more lengthy. I would save and close. And all the tabs that are going across would need to be completed. That would give us a better picture of her background and the current pregnancy as well. So, there's a gestational age tab where you would be able to put in her LNP or the first day of her last menstrual cycle. Let's just put in any date. And it'll create how many weeks she is right now. And her due date would also be adjusted. We always scroll down to indicate what trimester she is. So, let me scroll a little more. My first trimester. My first trimester. We indicate the date that she's starting prenatal care, not with us, but with the OB provider's office. So, if we're aware of that date, we'll just put in elsewhere and a date that she's going to start care. So, this is the most commonly utilized ones we would use. Then we'd go across again to the other tab, which is a historical tab of past pregnancies and what have you. And we'll just kind of indicate if she's had a history of other pregnancies. So, this is the tab we would use here. And it would auto-populate if she had other pregnancies. Let me just keep going up. We have an education tab that we use for every visit. Depending on which trimester we're meeting the client, we would update that as well after the teaching has been completed. So, for example, she's a first—it's a first home visit and she's first trimester. And we've discussed all of these topics here. We would check off here. It would have our initials also listed. And we'd just save and close. Then we'd continue on to our prenatal tab where the bulk of our notes are going to be listed. And we'd scroll down to the assessment tab down here. We would add an update. We would select always high-risk pregnancy and go to AP details, which is assessment planning details. So, these are our impressions. I could create a note, but essentially it's what you're saying with the client. Hmm. Oh, okay. So, it was just a sample. You can add your particular plans for the client for future visits or what you've advised her to do. Like, if you—she has a future appointment coming up to make sure she's compliant to continue to take her prenatal vitamins. Just some of those nuances that are individual to each client. And then we just save and close, save and close here. And then we go to the SOAP tab, scroll down to the bottom. There's a generate note icon down here. And we always create a master document at the end of every visit that gives us a picture of everything that was documented. This is a little skim because it's a very short note. But essentially, that's what it would look like. So, that's kind of the nurse's documentation in a nutshell, if it was a home visit. But that's really what the workflow looks like. And once we're done with this piece, if this is the actual first intake, and we want to go to the SOAP tab, if this is the actual first intake, and we want to—we checked in, we always have to check out as well. I'm trying to go back to the PM side. So, here's the checkout process. Right-click again, press checkout. Just auto-flow, make sure you're getting non-billable. For this one, I would select home visit. Prenatal, then we would go here for the high-risk pregnancy. And just continue to auto flow. And the fee would be adjusted because it is a non-billable program. And if you look back at EPM now, it's bolded in black, indicating I've checked in and out. Rahel, can you do us a favor and go back to the EHR and show what the CSAs do? Show their templates? Their templates, hold on, let me see if I can. They're a little bit different, and I'm not as well-versed on them, to be honest. I'll share and show it, but essentially it's pretty much the same thing. And then one other thing to add, one of our biggest disappointments with NextGen has been our inability to get good reports. So everything that you saw Rahel click, like when she clicked that the person came in in their first trimester, and we would love to be able to get those reports. We could see how many of our clients came in first trimester, how many came in late. And right now that isn't something we can get out of NextGen. We have limited reporting. So we're hoping for that with Dr. Cloud. Do you have your reporting requirements kind of spec'd out somewhere that we could review from what you're looking for? Yeah, some of that I put in the chat, and then I'll show you, we'll show you these next templates that'll show you as well. Okay. All right. So for the CSA, it's pretty much the same thing. One thing, one quick note to mention, any, you know, I would say let's get the requirements and then once there's enough data in the system, then after we go live, then we can work on getting these reports put together for you. Okay. Okay. That's what NextGen said too, though. So we've had some, we're having some PTSD here, but yes. Sorry about that. Yeah. Just because of the timeline that we have is all that. No, I won't blame you guys. I'm sorry. I was just adding that in. Go ahead. All right. So again, the documentation is pretty much the same. The only thing that's different for the CSA is because they are, you know, GCNAs, we try to simplify what they document and how they document. So they come over to MCH template and then everything. Oh, there we go. Okay. So for example, like the visit was first trimester. So our health stuff is already in there, but essentially what they would do is they would ask the client, okay, when was your last prenatal appointment? They enter in the date, they ask them these questions, they mark, you know, yes or no, and then they will review the first trimester education and then hit the check all. So everything will populate and then it'll have the date and the client's initials. If there's anything additional that they reviewed, they can, you know, pre-text it in here and then the date and the initial will auto-populate and then they put first trimester education and then they save it and then, you know, and then everything will populate as a master note. And then the other thing that everyone has to do is the reporting, or Becky, you said you sent that to him already, so skip that. Go ahead, let's go through it. Oh, okay. All right. So the outcomes, that helps like with our reporting for when the client delivers. They had this discharge outcome info. So this template, they have to fill everything out in here and then based on our quality measures or our goals, then particular items within this template is pulled. So some of our goals is like breastfeeding, family planning, PCP. So once they fill this out, we're able to run that report and pull if that client completed that goal. And then the other thing is the pregnancy outcomes. So this is where all the baby's birth information is entered, where it's, you know, a live birth, method of delivery, all that stuff in there is captured. And then this is how we're able to pull, you know, our full term versus preterm versus vaginal inspection, et cetera. So they fill that in. And then the last thing that they also do is this risk factors. So they click anything in here that is applicable to the client and then that's how we're able to pull, you know, whatever frequent diagnoses or what risk factors that we're seeing in a high occurrence for our CERB population. So that's pretty much for the CSAs. The checkout process is the same. The other thing that I would say that is really tricky with case management is that because NextGen is kind of like a doctor's office kind of platform, we're kind of using the patient portal as kind of a way to monitor case loads. So for example, let me just go to this nurse for example. So unfortunately, a task equals enrolled client. So if for any reason, let's say this nurse completes this task for January 27th and then forgets to create a new task for the next time she has to follow up with this client, then this client will pretty much like drop from her case load. So we have to be very diligent with this task because this task is what is able to kind of keep track of who you're following. And then also for me as the manager to see how many clients are active and assigned to the nurse. So ideally, what would be preferable for Dr. Clout is instead of this task list, if I could have an actual like queue where cases could be assigned in the patient's chart, either nurse case management, CSA case management. So that client is already kind of attached to that pool. And then the individual nurse has her case load that is, and the tasking is kind of separate from the actual case load. So I'm not that. Yeah, the ability to assign cases to a staff person and have a list of who the staff person is. And then also the ability for the staff person to discharge clients or take them off their cast list when they're done. Next Gen doesn't. I think the only way to get discharged out of Next Gen is to die maybe, but you never can say if you can only write in notes that we're no longer following. It's not something that. Well, yeah, we write a note and then we just close the task or complete the task. And then that's how they're discharged. But if the new, if that could be managed within a caseload list of some sort, and Dr. Clout, that would be very helpful for us. As well as those three or four kind of templates she just showed you, those are the ways we have figured out how to get reports out of Next Gen. So that's what we're collecting now. I think I can, we could make them better with the new system. So I will look at those and get that to you too. The actual, our actual outcomes that we want to collect. Okay, sounds good. Yeah, the notes put in the chat are also very helpful. Oh, and one more thing, we also do immunizations, so we'll, I think if you could walk through that too. That will also be embedded in Dr. Clout as well and connected to Immunet. Can you walk through a fake IZ case? Sure. Although maybe you all have met with immunizations already at Dennis Avenue, it's, it should be the same process with both, or there's three different programs who do childhood immunizations and we should all do it the same. Okay. Do you want to see us do it? It's better for you to show them, Becky, because they didn't met with immunizations. Okay. But we don't want to miss anything that you might need. All right, Angela, go for it. Say that again? You want us to go through IZ case? You want to walk us through a test immunization case? Oh, okay. Okay. We'll just use the same. Yeah. We'll use the same lady. Okay. I'm just going to close these out. I'm just going to add another date, same day, but different encounter for the specialty for every immunization. Actually, you've got to share your screen again, Rahel. Oh, okay. Sorry about that. No problem. Okay. Can you guys see my screen now? Okay. You can see it. All right. There you go. Yes. Okay. Thank you. So for the specialty for immunizations, it's always pediatrics and the visit type is under nurse visit. We always go back to intake. Do you track your inventory of immunizations? In NextGen? No. We can check what we've... I think not. Right, Angela? We can check what we've used, but we don't put in what we've got, but we would love to. I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. It's kind of echoing. What's the question? The question is, do you track the inventory of your immunizations that you have on hand? Our inventory right now is tracked manually. So yeah. So it's not... Yeah. But it's something that they need. It's something... Yeah. Lovely. Yeah. Yes. So Angela and Becky, if you guys don't have it, but you need it in the system, just let them know so that they can start thinking how we're going to add that to your flow here. But yes, they do need it. Great. Thank you. Sure. So the visit is immunizations. So you would click on that option and you would just write a brief note, five-year-old presented for vaccines and arrived with mom and just close the intake tab. You would then go to the blue hyperlink for Pete's immunization. You would always select new. You always have to make sure you check off the VFC reason because we get our vaccines from VFC. They do audits. So if it's a Medicaid client, let's say on the forms that they fill out, we would fill that according to what the parent indicates. There's an allergy tab and, you know, you could just check off if they have allergies or no, they don't, and then save it. You would then scroll down to category, which is always vaccines for children, and then check off which vaccines they're getting. Just to make it easy. We'll just pick one vaccine. Oh, okay. Let's see. Okay. Let's pick. So then the vaccine that you've selected will now show up on the lower part of the screen. Then you would have to put in vaccine details, which is how you administer it, which route and the vaccine lot number. So Rahel, that pop-up that just came up was telling you, you can't give that vaccine to that age kid. Yeah. So that would be something else. I mean, my guess is Dr. Cloud knows this already, but that's a good feature that NextGen helps us keep safe with our immunizations and keeps us from giving the wrong things. Yeah, that's really helpful too. It's a good sort of like warning if we're giving something that's out of the age range that's appropriate for that child. So that's true. That's true. Okay. So let's pick up any lot number. We have to select where we administer it. So let's say left deltoid. The consent administered has to be selected by an adult. Everybody has to come in with an adult because they're minors. And then we have to always give them the vaccine information sheet document as given. And then we just save it. And once we press save, it goes to the Immunite state system. So there's a communication between NextGen and all the vaccines given will be communicated to that system. So next time they come, we're able to also see it on that end. So save it. And then we go back to intake and scroll down to the bottom where we could generate the intake note, which will again indicate what vaccine the child has received today. And once this is done, the admins are given the chart and they will in turn check out the client. Because we do bill for immunizations, either Medicaid or we take or sliding scale money. We don't do any insurances, but Medicaid, we do them. So we follow all those rules for that. The only other thing I can think of that we do is pregnancy tests. Which I know I couldn't. Angela, do you know the documentation for pregnancy tests? Um, I mean, I don't really have all the steps. I know the admins like check it in and the CSAs do something, so that I can't show. But maybe one of the admins can you guys at least show the check-in part for the pregnancy tests? I'm sorry? I was saying if that's something that needs to be seen, at least maybe one of the admins can show the check-in process for the pregnancy tests. But it's something really small that is that mirrors the check-in and check-out for the other tests. Yeah, I was more thinking of the way we document the pregnancy test. It's just like what I did before, it's just a case management note, and then they add in the diagnosis code, and then the pregnancy test CPT code, and then that's it. All right, yeah, so the code is either positive or negative. All right, babies born healthy, do you do, I don't think you do anything that we haven't discussed here already. Do you? Am I missing something from you all? No. Okay, and can anyone else think of, I mean, it seems like that didn't take long enough for all the work we do. But am I- Also, anything that you can think of are reportings, that if you are running a report, and you know it's something that you cannot capture in NextGen currently, because we don't have that module, or you don't have that ability to do it and keep your data in NextGen so that you can run electronic reports, and you are doing everything manually, that's a good opportunity also to mention, hey, we don't have this, we are doing manually, but we would like to have it as part of our flow. Yeah, no, and I see what you put in the chat for me to answer, and I will answer that. And some of it I think I answered, and I just, we put, gave you already, but yes, we need to, we will decide exactly what we want for reports. Exactly. Yeah, even if you are keeping it now in a spreadsheet, but for example, if somebody is asking you for how many pregnancy tests you are running, you know, and you don't have that little area in NextGen or, you know, in the current EHR, but you would like to have that area, the new EHR, and you want that to be linked to a report, then let them know so that they can start thinking how they will help you to keep your data going. Great, perfect. Have I, have we forgotten anything else? I'm sorry, Jamila, you were saying something? Oh, yeah, I was going to say, along with forms, but a template, is there a template maybe that you had, like, NextGen make for you or that you altered or anything like that, or there's a template that you use that maybe doesn't have all the information or that you altered or anything like that? For reports or for? Yeah, just for reports, just like your everyday, you know, workflows, you know, because some programs, yeah. It could be a workaround. What Jamila is mentioning is that some of the departments, some of the areas, service areas, didn't have what they needed in totality in NextGen, but they were able to create something, you know, like some workaround in the system to be able to capture something. So, for example, in your department, we currently don't have a case management module, so the visits are not entered in the schedule, correct, Angela? Because otherwise, it will trigger a visit. We are, we are doing that as an event, I think, that's how the department is doing it currently. Is anybody clinical in here who can help me to check myself on that? I was going to say, I just, I remember we did, we did an alternate workaround. I do remember that. Yeah, well, I, I, we do all kinds of workarounds, and it's, I think we've showed you some of them today. For example, the fact that we check in and check out the very first case only. We don't put the rest of them into the EPM as, as encounters, because we don't bill, so we don't, we only need to do that for the first one, and that's just so we can make sure the staff opened up the case. Right, but if you had a case management module, you would be, the staff would be able to enter the EPM. Exactly, we are ready to do that. Yeah, so then if you did show a workaround, Dr. Cloud will not know that, so you need to let them know this was a workaround. wrong, but we want to have it this way. No, right. I think we said that while we were going through it. How else do we make them know that? Okay. So, case management work. I do have another question, and like I said, correct me if I'm wrong. When you enter the mom and baby, do they have the same chart? Do you still do that with the same chart? And if it's like a reason why? We don't answer babies right now. We just do one case. It's the mom. The mom? Except for the immunization, and then it's just the baby. Okay. Okay. We found that to be, I mean, they are the dyad. We're doing everything with both of them, so we didn't see the need to have both cases in. Okay. And NextGen also made that really complicated. See, that's another thing, and so it wouldn't be, so maybe Dr. Clowell can help with that aspect in terms of the mom and the baby when they come in. Yeah. It would be nice to have the baby have a chart, so if something happened to that baby later, we would know. I was just going to say, exactly, exactly, because we wouldn't know. But yeah, right now, we couldn't make that work. Okay. So, that's another thing. I guess I'll write it down. In terms of the mom and the baby right now, they're just charting the mom, so, you know, like you said, if something happens to the baby, we wouldn't know because it's not charted. Okay. That makes sense, yeah. Not that it's not charted. It's just not charted in the baby's chart. It's not charted in the baby's chart, yes, yes. The baby has no chart. Yeah. Which, again, a lot of these are patients, but newborns. Sorry. She's talking about newborns. Newborns. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, newborns. Right. We follow them when they're pregnant and then through six months of their pregnancy. Yeah. Do you need the baby to have a chart or something linked to the moms so that you guys have separate information or no? One of you all can correct me, Angela or Dabra, Rahel, if I'm wrong. I think we, it'd be great if we could put the baby's name in there in the mom's chart and then later, if that baby showed up, the system would be able to know that we know that baby already. I don't think we want two charts. That's... Correct. But you want to... We're just doing one set of work. Right. Right. So, Dr. Clout, they will need an area where they can identify the newborn inside the mom's chart. So, and maybe this is a, go ahead, go ahead, I'm sorry, Dr. Clout, go ahead. I was going to say, I think we need to discuss this one internally to come up with a solution, right? Chris and Ramesh, I don't know how we do this today. Yeah. We track everything, you know, every client has their own chart, so baby would have its own chart. Do you put family members and link family members? Something families? You can put in, yeah, you can put in contacts, but we don't, we don't do immediate links Just because of the whole HIPAA thing, it's difficult to, you know, put charts together, you know, we just... Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. So, I think we, sorry guys, I've been listening with one ear, but in terms of this request, I think across the board, an HHS thing that I need to take back. So the Dr. Clout team, let's talk through what some of the possibilities are, because we do serve households, right? And especially where we have children that are in care of other folks, we need to know and have that housed in our system as a household, not just a person paying insurance, like we said the last time, right? I just need to figure out, okay, what we had in the contract regarding a requirement around this, and I think we had something, but I probably can't find it right now, in the spreadsheet, in the other thing that we signed, but this is a general request, a general way we work, right? Chris and Ryan, it's not a program by program request, it's the way we do our case files here at HHS. And it's also because we have an integrated practice, and we could be serving family members that we need to know these things about family members together, from a practice perspective, okay? But we, that's one of the things that we are, we need to talk through about, what's the closest we can get to doing this. Yeah, if we can just get clarity on the requirements here, and specifications, then we can try to, like I said, we'll internally just discuss what the solution could look like, and then we can come back to you. Yes. And I'll write that up and get back to you. Okay. Thank you. But Becky, do they have a, is this a recommendation or a requirement, the reason why we are not documenting on the baby's chart? The mom is our patient. We start when they're pregnant, and she's our patient, and we don't actually, I mean, we're teaching the mom how to be a mom, and we don't really even, you know, the nurse doesn't even assess the baby necessarily. I mean, so yeah, the mom, that's why we've always done it, we call it a family chart and the mom is the patient for the work we do. Whether that's a requirement, that's just how we've done it. The baby is not, never a patient of us, like, we don't give them any medical advice to the baby, right? We don't tell the mom anything in relation to the baby, it's all related to the mom. Oh, certainly. We say, don't forget to go to your pediatrician appointment, and we help them breastfeed, but it's always as the dyad of the mom and the baby together. I mean, this could be a Dr. Davis question, because originally with NextGen, we did open up the babies when they were born, and then we realized it was cumbersome, and we were duplicating documentation, because the same thing was happening to both, the same education, the same home visits. Okay. So, like, when the nurse goes in, they help the mom how to breastfeed, and then do they check the baby? The baby is, you know, nourished and pink or brown or whatever, do they do that kind of assessment with the baby? So, are they looking at the baby to see if the baby's malnourished or anything? So, that's what I'm thinking in terms of... We don't weigh the babies, we don't bring baby scales, we do make sure they go to the pediatrician. Again, Angela, Rahel, Dabur, you can chime in. Yeah, we're case managers, we're educating the mom on baby care, we're looking at the baby, we're giving information about breastfeeding, jaundice, we are really, yeah, we're kind of eyeballing the baby and supporting the mom, but we're really urging her to see the pediatrician who will be doing the clinical aspects of really assessing the baby for weight, doing the PKU, giving vaccines, so we're sort of the eyes to really connect them to resources, but essentially, we really encourage them to do the clinical follow-up with the pediatrician. So, I think what Rahel said is key, we're the case managers, not the clinical... We're not clinical nurses following them, we're providing nurse case management, which is different. So, essentially, it just gets documented as education to the mom versus documenting it in the baby's chart. Right. Okay. And the baby is added in the historical part of the mother's chart, so all the information of the delivery, what type of delivery, any complications are embedded in the maternal chart as well. Okay. And again, yeah, I think NextGen operates kind of like... Our part of NextGen is an obstetrician's office, so that obstetrician, that OB doesn't do anything with the baby, so, I mean, they talk about, again, right, birth outcomes, but they don't touch the baby. So, all of the stuff in NextGen under the obstetrician part is more mom than baby. Okay. I guess we can talk more about it, because I'm just thinking, you know, scenarios like say... Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Does anybody else from our side think, can think of anything we forgot to say that we do? So, this is a non-billable clinical case management. I just need to make sure we're... Non-billable for now, clinical case management. Yes. We will gladly take money if someone wants to pay us for it. Let me add there in the notes that if you can provide the current CPT and ICD that you guys are using, that would be super helpful so that we can look into that for you, at least as a, you know, just to know. Right. Okay. I mean, we only use CPT and ICD on that first visit. Otherwise, we don't. Am I correct, Angela and Rahel? There's nowhere to put the codes in. Yeah. It's just for that initial intake. When we check in and out, that's the only time we put in the CPT codes. Okay. So, we're only billing for one part of the service. And we're not even billing... Yeah, for the initial one. For the initial visit of consult. That's the only time we put in. Yeah. And it's still labeled as non-billable. So, we can check on that. If you guys can send me that information, that would be helpful. And then, do you need me to check and see if the follow-up visits can be billable and what is required if? Yes. Yeah. So, what I want you to do, Diana, if we can talk, check that folder for me on the workflow because we talked to Becky's group again already. There are a few other pieces that are connected to them. That's a referral from the internal DACT team. So, it's not just this space. So, it's a larger picture than what we're talking about going next gen right now. And I don't want to do just a CPT code thing. So, we can have a conversation with them about their work process, but there's a lot of information regarding their process currently and what we would like it to be moving forward in that space. So, we can work that through. So, it's not just a code. Most of it right now is going on a spreadsheet. And the spreadsheets are also there. So, we'll meet up with you again, Becky, with some questions. Folks are putting lots of good things in the chat, too. I see. It's very helpful. Thank you. Dr. Nenbar, we have about 15 minutes left, and if it's appropriate, Chris can maybe show the caseload manager. Folks on the call want to see what that looks like. I think we'd love that. Okay. Chris, do you want to take the screen? And then Angela's note on staff schedules, seeing what clients and staff are going to see your call. Yeah. So, there will be calendar events created. You can see all of the different staff provider schedules in a view. So, you'll kind of know what's upcoming for the days and the weeks, and we'll get into that in another session. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. So, let me just go ahead and show you guys the system here. So, what we're looking at right now is, and let me just go over the way the screen is laid out. We have the top section here, which is where we can see the client that we currently have selected, and then we have this main navigation bar that allows us to navigate to the different areas of the system. And where I'm at right now is on my caseload view, and so I can see these are the clients that are currently assigned to me as the provider here. But as a supervisor, I can also see the list of clients that are assigned to the people that I supervise. So, I can look at different providers, and then I can see their caseload, and I can see different details related to each of those clients on that person's caseload. And then I can also see the next upcoming appointment for their clients. I can create an appointment from this view. So, I can just say, I want to create an appointment for this person, and then say what it is we're going to be providing in terms of the appointment, and then that would show up on the dashboard as well. In addition, we can set up specific date-related rules around specific forms needing to be completed in a certain timeframe. So, for example, you go back to my list here, my caseload view, I have a rule set up that says that within two days of admission, I need to make sure that I have a release of information on file. And so, that's what this notification here, this box on this table is showing me, is the date that this was due was two days after they were admitted. And the red frowny face here lets me know that I was not in compliance with that date and getting that form done on time. If I want to fill out this form from the dashboard, I can just click this little icon here to pop up the form in a new window here, and I can go ahead and fill out the form right from my dashboard. So, this caseload view is also customizable in terms of the columns that I see here. So, I can click on this Manage Columns, and then I can select the things that I want to see, if I want to include date of birth, or I, you know, want to not see the, you know, anything like that, I can just manage those columns by checking boxes or unchecking them. And that's what manages my view here. And can I see who that, who Annie Admin has seen this whole year, even though some might be discharged? Yeah. So, that would be a report. And so, I can go in and see if it's, you want to see, like, all the clients that were seen by this person in the year? Is that what you're asking? Sure. So, I would go to, I can look at my provider service report, and I can go back a year. And then I can choose Annie Admin, and then search for all of the visits. And actually, then, so this is all the visits that were done by Annie Admin for the year. And in addition to the information about the visit, I can also see the forms that were completed and the percentage of completion on those. So, I can see that this progress note was 100% complete. I can see that this recovery mentor note was 0% complete. And so, this is also where I can see productivity, as well as completion of notes that they've done. Great. Quick question. Oh, yeah. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. What was the question about or comment about this report? Oh, yeah. I was going to ask, is there, like, I see that. Is there, like, a visual dashboard with, like, charts or anything like that that the management can look at and say, okay, these people have been checked out. This is what they're doing every day, like a productivity report, a visual aid? Yeah. So, we have, I mean, if the question you're asking is what have my providers been doing over a certain period of time, you know, that's actually a different question than who did they see during that time, right? Yeah, the productivity report. Oh, yeah. We do have a productivity report where I can see the activities of providers in a given timeframe. So, I can look back at the different dates and times here, and this is going to show me all of the, sir, all of the types of visits that were provided. And that would include, you know, when they were in the office. So, if I want to exclude those things, I only want to see client visits, I can say type of service individual, and then it's going to limit my results to just who they saw. Or I can say individuals and groups. And then when I search, it's just going to show me those visits instead of all of the appointments that were on their calendar for, you know, lunch or a vacation or in the office or those kinds of things. So, this is now showing me the number of visits, the number of units, and it looks like these were groups with nobody that were, that was checked in. But then there's one client that was served here, and let's see if there was a, yeah, these are all group. So, this is a group session. These were the client IDs that were served in that group session, in this recovery wellness group. So, they served six clients in this session. So, this is, yeah, this is an example of productivity where we can see a summary of their activities over a given timeframe. And the ones above it would be maybe what we call the no-show visits, yeah? The ones that all have zero in the inbox? Yeah, these are appointments that were not, never checked in for. Yeah, that is something that we monitor as well. Yeah. And they can see the minutes spent with that patient, right, based on that? Mm-hmm. Yep. And the point that they registered until they end the visit. Yep. You know, in some of the systems, when the registration process start, we are able to complete that registration process, and the patients change the status to pending, waiting for provider. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. It's that something that the provider will have visual knowledge in the back end, so that they don't have to have, let's say, not just in this practice, but in any other practice that we have. So that even if the person in the front is still busy with somebody else, the provider will see an update, like a cue, you know, that they see, okay, Diana's now waiting for me pending, ready and pending for the provider. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. I don't know. How would, how the provider gets notified? Are they able to track that on their end, in their schedules? So, are you talking about somebody that has arrived, and they need to be notified that they need to see them now, or is this just? No. Someone that's been assigned. Yeah. We assign the patient. So, for example, Becky comes to the office today, right, and then I welcome her, and she has arrived. So, I'm checking her as arrived, while I'm working on her demographic, entering her information, right? Then I complete that section, but I assign that to the provider who she's scheduled to see today, right? Yeah. In other systems, I'm not talking about NextGen, but in other systems that I have used previously, we, or the provider has a, it accesses. see what's the status of their patients like if they are ready for them. You know what I mean like are they pending waiting for the nurse to like work on the patient or like do they have something similar to that in Dr. Glau where the providers can track what's the status of the patient? Yeah I can see the status of their appointments in their chart here. So I have a list of appointments that are coming up and then I can see the status of those appointments. Chris but they will have to go inside the individual patient's chart right? Like you don't have like something that they can see in this schedule to check like a it could be like a code a color code. Yeah yeah definitely. Green is pending or red is done you know whatever. Yeah we have I just don't have them populated right now but if I go back. So this would be you know you can have the colors for the different types of appointments or it can be colors to indicate where the appointment is being held. And then there's also this icon here that gives a status of this appointment. So this in this case we have a smiley face letting me know that this appointment is scheduled but if I check them in for this appointment then that icon will change. So if I go here and say check-in check-in has arrived it's going to create the encounter for this individual appointment and it's going to take me to that encounter to go ahead and document my visit and it can actually open up a form by default to fill out as part of that visit. But if now I go back to the schedule and I look at that appointment I now see a green check mark here that lets me know the status of that is now they're checked in. Okay that's what I'm saying okay. Yeah and I can see I can choose different views and I can also select multiple providers so I can come down here and I can choose you know multiple providers and then it's going to show me if I look at the day view it's going to show me those schedules side by side so I can see all of the providers calendars that I've selected. And there's also this notification up here it's going to go away pretty quickly but that also is a notification to me to let me know that my appointment has been checked in for and the person has arrived. But this view of the schedule allows me to see multiple providers calendars side by side. Right. And then I can also we also support dragging and dropping the appointment to change it so that's also. Do you have a queue like a queue that the manager let's say is sitting let's say Becky is in the back but she wants to see how many patients have been already checked in or if somebody's still pending and waiting is what time they were waiting. You know what I mean like managers usually control that flow on the in the clinics but do you have something to track that so that they don't have to go specifically in this view and look into individual appointments but they can see in a queue what's the status of that appointment. Yeah I have the ability to see appointments in a report so I can say show me all the appointments today and then see the status of those. I just don't have any set up in here right now for today but if I go back a couple of months and I search it'll show me here's the appointments and the status is also going to show up here. So I can see for the day what are the appointments that we have and I can filter those based on the location of the appointment, the program, the provider of that appointment, even the type of appointment that they're running. I can filter it to that extent if I want to. Okay thank you. Yeah the other thing I wanted to mention was the immunization you know administrations. So if I go to the client record here then I have down here near the bottom I have the option to add an immunization. I can see what they have received in terms of immunizations administered and then I can edit this and I can see a table view of the administrations of immunizations and this would be you know connected to Immunet is the ultimate goal. I'm not sure when we're going to be able to get that done but this is what we would be you know communicating with Immunet and then I can add a new immunization here for this client and I would just start by putting in the CVX code or a description of the I could type also a description so I can just start typing you know whatever it is I'm going to be administering and then select that and then it's going to pull in it's going to let me know if I use one that I have in my inventory then it's going to show me and then I would be able to select the the trade name of that immunization from my inventory the lot number that we have for that in our inventory and then the NDC code and then I would say you know when it was administered how much was administered and then the amount administered you know whether that was milligrams or whatever that is and then the route of administration the location of the administration and so on and so forth so then I can you know save that immunization administration for this client. Yeah, I think making sure this is linked with Immunet is essential for us. Yeah, I'm not sure they'll use it if it's not linked to Immunet because then we'd have to put it in both places in the state. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah. All right, any other questions? We're kind of out of time. We're kind of out of time. Becky and Tim, if you can just ping me with your questions if you have any and I'll pass it along. Okay. I did have my hand up because I wanted to check and I'll check in the requirements document because checking in for us in an integrated space is a little bit more complicated than just checking a client in for EHR. We do have a lobby management system on site that gets a little bit confusing when clients show up so I want to just set that stage for everyone that when someone comes to the site they probably are coming in from multiple programs at a site so the ones that are using EHR to check in and check out we have to start thinking about the workflow about you know what the client is experiencing on site because there is also a lobby management system there. I have to check the contract because I think I put it in there for an integration between our lobby management system and EHR. I just need to check. Ryan, if you could do that for me that that'll be helpful or Kumar, Summer, if you're online. You warned us a month or so ago that we'd be that we're next on the list so yes but we're in no rush so don't worry about it. Right, but you know it's a customer site so the one of the things I also want to ask before we leave I know we have three minutes is and Chris you can get back to me for the check-in process we can do that through the client portal, right? Yes, it is possible. Well, when you say check-in it might mean something different than how we interpret it but we interpret check-in as indicating that I've arrived for my appointment. So two types, I'm very sorry. I know the one where you can check in and you get your intake data and the one where you're on site and you can say yes I am here. Yep, yep. Can you, is the client portal capable of doing both? Yes, yes. All right, perfect. Summer, Kumar, can you check on that thing for me or even Ryan on the on the on our lobby management system integration? Okay, okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. I appreciate this. Anything, anything else that we're collecting just send it over Becky and I'll put it in our same document folder that we had before. Chris, Ryan, everything that I had promised is in the document folder on the program. So the TAP, the document from FISPO, that's inside the SharePoint. Great, we'll take a review. Appreciate it. Thank you, thank you guys. Thank you. I'll stop the recording now. Thanks. Thank you, bye-bye. All right, thanks everybody. Thanks everyone. Thanks for Helen, Angela, for driving. Thank you.",
