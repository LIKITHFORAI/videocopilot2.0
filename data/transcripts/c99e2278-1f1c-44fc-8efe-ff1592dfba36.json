  "text": "Sorry, this was, um, it's all right, public health. Oh, public health, okay. That's fine. Hello. Good afternoon. All right. Okay, so I don't know. Some are what things you have, whether you've got a chance to create the template for tomorrow, or how we want to use, you know, these smart sheet view or, you know, the one page view Ryan had sent earlier. Oh, I thought you just wanted me to update the timeline slide on the PowerPoint that we currently have. That's just the one update aside from that. This is, I guess this is where we discuss. Not much has been done aside from the workflow meetings but you all. I guess this is where we have shut out. Yeah, but also we have the, you know, the project plan now. Right. So, we need to kind of provide links to the county. Right. Because Richard has been asking so you could do that but before we do that. I have a few questions. To the Dr. Cloud team we can go over that. Do you want to go over that now I can reserve it for you know later on, if you want to update the weekly, this thing, we can do that right now. No, you can ask your questions I can make the necessarily need. A second. Okay, so I'll share my screen. Okay, so I can have. This is very helpful. Thank you, Ryan for providing the link. Yeah, I know the spreadsheet was like I couldn't make out but I couldn't see the timeline or is the impact of that or whatnot. Right. Okay. Yeah, so this is a very helpful. I probably can, I think, hide this column right. Yeah, let's just hide this. No, you can't do anything. No, like I said, they're very. Yeah, I can just do it like this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and then I can move this year. I'm actually surprised. I'm happy, but I'm also surprised that you can even view it because that's how locked down. So I was kind of testing it to make sure you could. Yeah, it says you know view only so yeah I could view it. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, you know, this is fine you know what we're talking about the phase one. Now phase two. When you're talking about in a configurations and integrations right. So there we have setting up program so that's like you know we expect to do that here. Service list calendar category that's also fine. A lot of this information comes from the requirements. Exactly. So that I'm, you know, assuming. Now this one. So is this, what is this one like add on to factor I mean this is who needs to. I mean I know we need to work with talks about that SSO right so is that. We need to work with it on this. Yeah. So Dr cloud has the multi factor authentication one time password. So when we go live, we'll just make sure that that's configured properly, but we should talk to it about the requirement just so they're aware of how it's going to work. Yeah, I can ask Ramesh how it's going to work because from a technical perspective I'm not sure how it's going to work. Yeah, I can ask Ramesh how it's going to work because from a technical perspective I'm not sure how it's going to work. Yeah, I can ask Ramesh how it's going to work. Yeah, I can ask Ramesh how it's going to work. Yeah, I can ask Ramesh how it's going to work because from a technical perspective I'm not really sure if Active Directory or SSO with the county mitigates this. Yeah, I can ask Ramesh how it's going to work because from a technical perspective I'm not really sure if Active Directory or SSO with the county mitigates this. Yeah, so just yeah. So if you can follow up on that one right so that's. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. And I can, you know, bring up the email that what we responded and I can send it to Ramesh also to get his perspective here this is what we said. And in your, I think on your website also it says you know you provide SSO integration so. Okay, so this is okay. Yeah, so, so somehow like you know because if we can reduce some time here, and this create users so this is essentially the users would be in Dr cloud I mean essentially they are mapped to a role. The users may be you know whatever you know count, you know, say, person at county.gov or whatnot. And then the users are added to Dr cloud is that what what this one is. Sorry, I'm typing Ramesh, what do you say? So what I was saying is this create users activity. So there you're just, you know, taking the users that you know you, they provided in that spreadsheet. Yeah. And then adding it to your system right. That's right. With the proper roles and things like that. Yeah, and above that was ACLs. So the ACLs are set up, that's the permissions right, active controllers, let's make sure everyone's associated inside of the right ACL group. Yeah, and we'll probably leave one or two, just to show one of the build folks. Here's how you put a user up in the system, here's how you create them, here's how you associate the ACL just so they have that. Yeah, so yeah, I know, and this is starting in February. Is there a way we could do start doing this earlier, like, you know, in January? Yeah, we will, we will. As soon as we get the info, everything you're looking at, I mean, those are just, they're dates that give us a little bit of time and padding if things move out and we can pull other stuff in. But everything that's in the spreadsheet, we're not going to wait until these dates, we're going to have this done ahead of schedule. Understood. Okay, someone had a question? I did. I just have been given some internal information that the list of the configuration team that we've been given, the county kind of wants to, they're asking for a way to, I guess it's twofold. One, they want to know about the security roles that they'll be assigned because I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to lock down the amount of access to each one of them or configure the amount of access to each one of those roles has within the configuration team. Like, and I told them that they probably needed to vet the list again, because once they're in the configuration team, they're going to see the back, in these meetings, they're going to see the back end of everything. And for whatever reason, they want to, I don't know, circumvent, they want to minimize, they want to kind of control which each one of these roles or each one of these service areas has access to. And I don't know, I don't know if that's possible before we start these meetings or how that would even work. I didn't get the answer, get the question, like you're trying to, is there a question behind what you just said or is it a comment, right? Well, it's a question if that's even possible or two, if they just need to re-vet the list that they sent because I knew Amir was adding them to the back end and once they have access to the back end, do they just have carte blanche to everything on the back end? Or is there like levels to each one of the roles? Or is there levels to roles on the configuration side? No. Chris is here, so I'll let him comment. But yeah, I think this is one of those things we need to push back on a little bit. These are part of the build and implementation team. Okay, and I think what I'm hearing the county ask for is they want to lock down the build and implementation team participants to the specific areas that they're going to be working on. But, you know, there's a lot of kind of interdependencies here. So, Chris, are there any ways to lock down implementation users to specifically what they're building out in the system? I mean, there's no ACL for that. Right? No, but we can handle that. I mean, if they tell us who needs to be able to do what, we can certainly configure that. I think the issue I'm having with this, Kumar and Summer, is the county is asking for a lot of us to tell them how to do things, which is good. But our system is a bit configurable, right? So we have to gather information from the county. They need to tell us, these people are going to be working on this part, billing, for example. These people are going to be working on admin or front office stuff. And then we can see, you know, I can work with Chris and the team to figure out how to just kind of lock up access inside of DrCloud. But we don't have anything we can provide that. Yeah. Well, the configuration team list that they provided is broken down per service area. So it is broken down by participants who are doing admin, fiscal, billing, IT. But I think that they were asking, like, based on the security rules, like, once they have access to the back end of NextGen, they have access to everything. And I think they were trying to, like, minimize that because of some of the internal issues that they're having with people changing stuff in the background and it not being the same across the board. And I figured I told them I would ask. However, if it needed to be if they needed to just go back in and vet that list again, then they possibly would have to vet that list again if it wasn't possible. Yeah. So let me let me get this thing. I'm having trouble understanding what we're talking about. I'm guessing this is what we are talking about. Yes. That would be. Yeah. So this is the list. Right. So you guys can see my screen. Yes. So, Summer, are you saying what you're saying is, hey, all these people like these five people for, you know, whatever they call it, you know, these 12 people in IT. Are you saying that whatever they are supposed to do in their respective, you know, program, I mean, whatever program or domain, whatever you want to call it. We want them to only be able to do what things that they are supposed to do. Is that what you're saying? Kind of. Pretty much. Yes. So be able to like they want to be able to control like how much like basically what they're able to configure. So, yes. But it being broken down by a system or a service area, that would be that would be accurate. Yeah. So, I mean, let's not talk about service areas because, you know, then we'll be able to help the whatnot, you know, will come in. So let's talk about like, you know, this individual I don't know what area or program they want to call it. Right. So in other words, let's say there's I'll just give an example. Let's see user management, like adding a user, resetting users or whatnot. Let's say the IT team is assigned that task. So what they are asking is if the IT team is supposed to do those tasks, user management, we don't want anybody else, you know, who is fiscal or billing to be able to do that. Right. Similarly, if fiscal is billing or billing, they're supposed to set up, you know, CPD codes or whatever things rates or whatnot. We don't want anybody else to do that. Right. That's what you're talking. Yeah. So I think. Or like fiscal and practice management probably need to be able to do interchangeable things because they'll have to load. They'll have to load codes and things of that nature. But then I see that they don't want IT to have access to that. Yeah. Whatever that is. So I'm just giving an example. Yeah. So what we need to do is we need to create like this is one table. I'm imagining this like let's put this in Excel and then we can have another, you know, adjacent column here. And, you know, you remember the implementation tasks that you have. So those implementation tasks, we can group it by, you know, whichever team they want, you know, them to do. I mean, you're right. We cannot say who should do what. They should tell us who should be doing whichever implementation tasks you have outlined. And we can group them like this. There can be some overlapping implementation tasks or, you know, configuration tasks across groups. But that's fine. But once we have that mapping, like imagine that these are the tasks that they would be doing on an ongoing basis, including implementation. Then, Chris, I think you said, yes, we can then set them up. Right. Is that correct? Yes. Sorry, guys. I just want to make sure when they say back end, are they talking about configuration pages or are they talking about like database back end? Because I don't think we're giving them that level. Configuration. And each configuration per group can be assigned per group. So, in other words, that configuration pages can be assigned only to that group. Is that configurable on Dr. Cloud like that? It's possible. Yeah. OK, cool. I just don't recall that when I was playing around with it. But yeah, OK, perfect. I can work with the county to create that. I think I just need to know what the options are available in terms of what they'll have access to. No, no, I don't think we even need to tell them somewhere. What we need to tell them is, remember, the implementation tasks Ryan has, you know, I mean, you had distributed all through the country. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So they need to tell us those implementation tasks, who will be doing in this group. That's all we need to know. Right. Once we know that. Yeah. And then, you know, Dr. Cloud team can set up the groups accordingly. Like, yeah, whatever. I think that's what, you know, I gather from this meeting. Ryan, go ahead. You're saying something. Oh, no, I was. I agree with everything you're saying. I was just going to let you know, Ramesh replied and said we can ignore the OTP if they're going to do SSO with Active Directory. Oh, yeah, that's true. I'll remove those. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Makes sense. Okay, so then, yeah, so this is fine. So, you know, so maybe if you want to be proactive, you know, if they have already sent an email to, you know, or send an email thread on this one. So someone just asked the questions. Hey, this is the list. Provide us the implementation tasks that you think these individual groups would be doing, and then we can set it up accordingly. Okay. I will definitely do that. I can definitely do that. Okay, so let me just go back to the project plan again. Also, while I have everyone since we're talking about back end. So for me and Osama, we've been requesting access to the stage environment for Dr. Cloud, but we still have not received that. Anyway, we can expedite that process. Sorry, we're just trying to get into the system, but we haven't been able to for. Who did you send your access request to? Summer, who did you reach out to regarding our access? Sorry, I was not involved in that. On the Dr. Cloud side, I'm not sure that I did. I reached out on the accounting side to make sure you guys had next gen access. Yeah, so maybe. Okay. Yeah, somebody may want to do that. And Ryan, who would be the person? Send an email to Chris and Neil with who needs to be given staging site access. And one of them will set up your site, folks, just like you. Yeah, thanks. Okay, I'll do that today. You'll be on an email. Okay, so that's fine. And this is. Yeah, so this is also. Okay. Now, the other question I have. Formwork flows, golden rules, thread, billing setup. Yeah, so these interfaces. Right. So. I mean, there's obviously, you know, multiple interfaces. Right. So, you know, this is a big ticket item, you know, for lab. And then similarly, you have each of the interfaces, I'm guessing, you know, set up as an activity or a high level activity. Right. So they're not all interfaces. If you look at the heading there, it's modules and interfaces. Some of them are third party interfaces like global pay or lab. But the patient portal module, for example, that's inside of. Yeah, it's inside of Dr. Yeah. And then somewhere we have to include now in the plan, update this plan with Dentrix or whatnot. Right. Yeah. What we're missing is Televox. Remember, that was not in scope in the contract. And so. Televox for appointment reminders. Okay. They want appointment reminders, but they did not pay for it and or sign up for it. Okay. And that's a gap. Okay. And so that needs to be updated in the project status for tomorrow to bring that to. Yes. That went through Mark. Ramesh, how do we connect them with pricing for Televox? We will share, have Unrock put together. Okay. Okay, great. Yeah, we probably. And this is, you know, in the this is a free go live, you know, the feud apply. Right. Not doing the implementation. Right. There will be some set up and things like that. But, yeah, for go live, there will be costs associated with it on sending messages and SMS and all that stuff. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, we need to quickly do that because then we'll have to have some addendum. Right. Okay. And then from the lab side to find out why they didn't pick it. Maybe they, you know, maybe the staff wants it, but the county is not looking to pick it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Then obviously, because we will be we submitted this information in the RFP, we would have said all of that stuff that we did in the response. Yeah, absolutely. So when we talk about this, Ramesh, can you give me a little bit of context? Yeah, sure. Yeah, we can talk through that. I mean, you may be right, like the staff wanted it, but they didn't get it or whatever reason. So we still need to wait that they really wanted it. Okay. Okay. So that's fine. You know, in this stuff and then in terms of real progress in us from feedback from Quest or, you know, straight lab, did you guys hear back from them? And we were the interface manager or the account manager from Quest and straight lab. We heard from Quest, but we haven't heard from the state lab. Okay. Okay, so and this is like after we shared this email with you, where Cherie says, you know, introduced us via email to the state lab, right? I think you may have independently received this email. I know that he put us in touch with Quest. Yeah, the state lab is a separate. Uh huh. Okay. Yeah, the state lab is a separate email trail. Uh, Maryland state lab introduction request. Yeah, so I think at least I don't have the Maryland state lab request. Okay. So let me just show you about my email. Ryan. I'm looking at the ones from series. Yeah. The one that I, the one that I sent to, um, the state lab. Right. They actually has a copy of the one from trees in it. Yeah. So Ramesh, this is the email you may have received from Ryan. Right. And it has, uh, yeah. I mean, you need to also send this email to you. Um, so. The state contact is Marcus. I was just looking at all the ones from cities. So. Okay. Yeah, that's right. Maryland state lab. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, and then if you want the email from Cherish, we can also send that to you. I'll just somewhere can you forward it? No, no, no, I I just was looking because he was the one doing all the introductions. I just search for all of his email, but yeah, it might be. It might be good like if we if you type piggyback on that email because then there's a context like hey, so it's introduced us. So you know that's why you're contacting them. Yeah, yeah, but I'm not on that email right? Yes, yes, yes. Of course you know I understand that so we will send you that is what I said. OK. OK, I'll go back again to this one. OK, so that's good. So we will, you know, update that. And so the response from Quest has been positive. They have been responding and like you know you have had some discussion with them or whatnot. It's only been email exchanges so far. OK, and do you need to have a meeting with them or you know you still? Yeah, probably that that conversation will have to be started. Yes, I'm right now. I'm trying to figure out what path we're going to take. OK, because. I don't want us to go through a net new. Build if you will, and so that's where things are at. So we want to, you know, we've been trying to figure out. The best mechanism. In terms of. Making sure they can get both. Orders and results in the time that we're talking about. Otherwise we'll have to fall back on that results only then come to orders after. OK, yeah, so if you get some timeline, you know, expectations or you know from Quest you know if you can send that email or you know involve the county also so that we can then say hey this is what they're seeing and therefore you know act accordingly, right? Yeah, sure. Yeah, so that would be good. So there's that and then what else I was thinking about? Yeah, so the data migration, right? So the data migration it's starting when formally in this plan. I noticed somewhere. Yeah, here, right? So this is like supposed to start, you know, so this we need to track very closely, right? So we need to like we have this risk identified roadblocker and if I had with the in a county every week will bring that up and what we may want to say is hey part of the plan we are supposed to start this. You know, in third week of January or whatnot, right? And if you I mean based on what we what you tell us, you know, it doesn't look like we're going to start doing anything because we don't even know what format or what data they will provide, right? So I thought they were going to give us the next extract on the next gen that we can look at. OK, but did we did this event we did? But we need to tell them they needed. Yeah, they told us that they couldn't do that until they got their contract amended. Yeah, but that was in the process. OK, so let's just that's what I'm saying. You know, let's just do that tomorrow again, saying that hey, we talked about this. When can we get you know the data or data extracts, right? They're trying to push back and do it all in one step, which I don't think is going to set us up for success and rummage can, you know, rummage and Chris have a lot of experience with this and they did. Our team typically imports like a test file too, especially if. If we need to bring in more than our templates allow for, then we need to work with our engineering team to update the scripts that can do that right. And also just make sure that from a. Schema perspective, the data is landing in the right place, so yeah, we need to get a small effort guys, right? It's not like you know we suggested the way we suggested the migration, yeah? OK, so let's see if they don't want to do it that way. Yeah, so let's talk about this tomorrow. I'd leave your hand up. Go ahead. Yeah, I think one of the issues right now is that as with those dates and I completely agree with remissioned Ryan, the challenge is going to be getting the data and getting even any set of data that would match our architecture. Doctor Cloud architecture. One thing and again I'm assuming here this is all internal so I can talk freely here. Yes, yes, one thing that Sam and I were discussing was somewhere the other day. It looks like next gen is going to give the state the county hard time on getting the data. But we might have a method that we can if we get access to the next gen servers on the county. We can build kind of like a I would call it like a surrounding thing to the EXE files and we would be able to track all of the all of the connections and from there we can extract the data externally ourselves instead of depending on on next gen. So that's something that is a work around. Obviously we need access to their servers to give us access to the servers and everything and we can build. We can start building something as a plan B in case we don't get this data structure and in this case we would have more control over what data we're extracting and matching it with Doctor Cloud because remission Ryan you can provide us with your templates and we can provide us with your templates. Or even access to your back end for the database and say hey this is where one things to land and we can start when we're building that kind of like conversion. We can do it that way again. This is I'm not saying like we've done this in similar other projects. Where we extracted it this way, but obviously there is a lot of risk here because that's not the straightforward way. But again, now if we're going to do it, then right now is the time so we can at least have a head start rather than just having it as a last resort or last minute. If it makes sense. Yeah, I I think so. It makes sense. So what I would ask you to do at least if you can work with Osama to come up with some maybe you know a couple of slides or something. So you know if you can be visual about hey this is how we're going to do this. You know you guys are pursuing whatever, but in the meantime we need to get our get our hands on the data and this is what we I believe the next gen is on Prem right? With the county, you know count is whatever AWS or somewhere it is there, but it is like on Prem in terms of it's not really on the cloud or something. So we can web based, but I don't know if it's saved on the cloud like on AWS cloud, but I don't know who owns the cloud. Because I heard from them many times saying we're going to get an AWS backup, so I assumed it's a backup from somewhere on the cloud. But again, I don't know who manages that cloud. If it's the next gen cloud or or a county cloud that I don't know. Someone what do you say? They're on the they're on the Citrix server so they are. From what I remember now I can confirm. They're not on. I don't think they're on AWS, but they are not. I don't think they're on the cloud either. Let me I'm typing up this email now. Let me just confirm. Yeah, you want to know if they're if they're cloud based. Yes, so I I think you know, I mean, yeah, I mean I can talk to. I can, you know. What do you call it? Touch with Sagar. I think he said on Prem. That's what I remember because all of the things screens you're you know they were showing us. It all looks like it. It may be on their own from DC data center and they may be using Citrix to connect and all of that stuff. All of those things may be true. I'm I'm a little confused as to one thing, so let me just so oddly you and Osama are going to be helping pull the data out of next gen. Is that what I heard? We're we're in like per our discussion with Sagar. One of the areas we would like to or will be involved in is the migration so we can help in the Mike getting the data out of next gen. Happy to do that or we can help in the migration into that. It depends on what is the area right now. We see that the bottleneck is next gen. That's why we're proposing that. But we're we're open to whichever if it makes sense. And I think I heard you say that you guys also may have a way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do. That's what we're proposing because of that bottleneck. Yeah, yes, yes, OK, yeah, so I just wanted to make sure that I have my facts straight as to know who we are going to be working with and getting this information out right? Because yes, the more moving parts there are, the more challenging it gets. Yes, yeah, so I mean, yeah, so basically Ramesh, you know, early in Osama, they were involved in the proposal process. So you know, in Sagar, we started with them so we kind of, although they are kind of working with us. They are actually in this and they are working in this to make whatever you need to happen. Like if you need assist with data migration or pulling the data. So that's something you know if we can help we would do so. So that's like extra one pair of hands we have to kind of help you with that. So so Adli, if you wouldn't mind, if you can come up and this doesn't have to be, you know. In a mini slide, just maybe couple of slides say say that this is what we are proposing and this is how we would extract the data and then you know we can talk about like hey how we interpret that. That's a separate issue, but at least we can say we we have a way we think we have a way to extract the data and this is what you need to do and outline all of the tasks the county needs to do so that we can present it and you know talk about it maybe 5 minutes, 7 minutes and say does this something you guys can do? And if they say yes, I mean which I think they could because they have some control over the on Prem system and they just need to give us access and what Adli you're saying is if you get the access you can pull the data right? We yeah, we can start working on building something to pull the data like we have to build something and Osama you can give more details here, but we have to build kind of. Think about it as almost like almost like you're putting their EXE files within a box so we can track all of the connections back and forth between the EXE file because right now everything is it's desktop based. It's not web based, so it's it's EXE files pretty much running this show. So how is that all communicating back and forth with the database, which is our goal here? Get extracting the data from the database. Does that make sense? But it does, Adli. It's almost I mean, if I'm understanding it, it's almost like you're putting a listener out on the network and watching the traffic go back and forth and trying to capture packets of data. Is that right? Or is it more advanced than that? We almost, but we're trying to do it more like reverse engineering of their EXE. Osama, you see, I don't know if we if we need to do that. The pro here right on this one. Yeah, yeah, I don't think we need to do that. Maybe we are better served. What version of next gen does the county have? Let's get let's find out that version. And then there is a website. That that certified health product lists have to publish that API is on. Oh, I don't think there. I don't think they have API on that version. That's an EXE based. I don't think they all. They all have to based on the version. It doesn't matter whether it's EXE or not. They all have to have certain APIs. If we can find out the version. Then we can look that information up. That sure we can. We can go ahead and start from there, but I don't know who would. Summer, would you be able to get from them that information and where is the hosting and everything? Sure, the whole thing of Yep and the version and the whole thing. Correct, yeah, OK, I can do that. Yeah, I can do that. Yeah, whose screen is it that we're seeing my screen? So come on, I'm putting something in the chat. This is a link for Doctor Cloudy HR. I'll just click on it. Yeah, hopefully it'll all work for you. I know we've been moving things around. This is probably not wrong. Did I click it long? Let me just copy the link and then paste it here. Yeah. Yeah, so. Yeah, if you're on the right hand side, if you scroll down. There should be something called a G10 criteria. This one export no G as in that's that's one. Yes, that's another. The B10 and G10 are two. Two APIs and so similarly right? Just like you have. Yeah, so if you click on that, yeah, so you know there's information on what needs to be done in fire and all of that stuff. So if you go to you know at the top there is something called search CHPL. All the way to the top in the blue bar or the dark. Color bar at the top. Right? Uh. There's a button called search CHPL. OK, search. Yeah. If you click on that. And yeah, in there just type next gen next gen. Yeah, and hit enter. So these are all next gen versions. OK. And it doesn't matter if it's cloud or not, so we just need to find out which version they have. Right? OK, 4.6. Click on the version on the left hand side. If you click on that. Any of them let's just this one. Yeah, click on that and so yeah on the right hand side again. You'll see that in 10 or G10 Yep. OK, got it understood. OK, so that you know. So this is something maybe we will just put in the chat and we can share it with the. County also. Yeah, so. OK. So in summary, if you can find out, you know, so guessing this is quite old. They have it since like. 15 years or something. So yeah, we all have. We all we all did it, so but there is 2025 as well. Yeah, so just find out which one you know they have. 2.14 or something. Yeah, I just pasted that in the chat. OK, so maybe we can go from there and then or some of your published APIs. This can give us access to you know the type of data that we can. I would. So this is what I would suggest. OK, I know the county wants access to the records, historical records. Those historical records they would have to work with next gen to get out and you know if next gen is a certified in the are certified EHR. You know there is something called information blocking rule. No, they cannot. They cannot block access to information, so the county you know should be able to leverage that. Right and whatever format they can. I would I would recommend as not going into this network listening and all of that stuff. You know, especially with counties, it takes a lot of lot of effort to get permissions to put network listeners on on the network. Yeah, no, no, I don't think we're going to go that far with like network. Listen on the network or somebody want to speak to me. We're going to do all of this on the EXE level. So I can explain that a little bit. Maybe just everyone. Yeah, actually, yeah, I know, but you know any of these applications are not allowed early. You know. They need anything that you're trying to reverse engineer and they're not looking for you to watch any of those things. So and plus I don't know how much of it we're even going to be able to make sense of. Yeah, I'm going to stop you if you want to spend cycles there. Yeah, but I would rather go down this approach and you know have them play nice with us because. That is how we can get the data that we need and we need to go to the county and say there is a real. There is a reality check that needs to happen. They're not. Going to see everything the way it was in next gen in this EHR. There is a you know we are not next gen. Yeah, so yeah, so I mean at least yeah. So my point is we can you know find that one that are like what version they have. And then you know we can even talk about hey the data migration. We need to start this activity sooner in a few weeks. You know in a matter of days or something. And what have you done and what can you? Can you do right? And this is one approach. APIs are published. You know if we can give us a version so we need to still need the credentials, right? You know they will still have to provide the credentials to get the API access right? Right, Ramesh? I mean, just knowing that the API exists is not going to help. They had to still provide us that credentials too. No, no, no, that all of that right that there is a reason there is sign up processes that they cannot block so we can get tokenization. All of that is standardized in a way. OK, so that. There is supposed to not be any cost to it. That's why those APIs are published, right? It's all. It's all based on fire. That's the protocol. Yeah, that's what I think is. Sagar also talked about this in one of them. Yes, if they are certified for smart on fire, which in all of these HR's we are supposed to do it. You know we are certified for it too, right? My point is that you know we can leverage standard fire with fire API's that for bulk import and we get what we get through that mechanism. Ramesh Ramesh in the RFP they said we could not use fire for extraction of data. That was part of the FAQ. That was the next gen response. Because if you recall, that was part of the challenges from the beginning. We assumed fire would put out a quick who put a question for the FAQ before even the RFP anything in during the RFP process. OK. That's why I'm I'm really hesitant. I mean, not how I really don't think they have API's the way that you think they have API's with the fire. They might be compatible. They have fire, but they said they would not be able to extract data. We would not be able to extract patient records using fire in the question. No, no, so there is. There is an extent of what we can extract. OK, it's you cannot extract images. For example, you cannot extract PDF's. There is a standard format for the type of data that can be extracted. It's called the CCDA format and there is a lot of data in it. That's why I'm saying I'm not going to have to set very clear expectations. I hear you. I'm not. I'm not getting it turned together. I'm just saying the answer for the question. Can we use fire to extract? Or to get to get the information to export the information and the answer was no, you cannot. I mean, I can get you. I mean, I have the FAQ. I'll pull it up. Yeah, yeah, do share that with me. I mean, you know it's possible again. Again, maybe you know, just like you. I mean, it's been a while for all of us. You were involved in the process too. It's been awhile, but I remember that clearly is that that was one of the areas I know I was involved in the process and you know it has been a while. Yeah, and if they said no and that meant that their version of next gen is not certified, possibly that possibly yeah, and if that's the case, then you know, yeah, they don't. They don't have to, but you know there is such a thing called information blocking. And we can drive down that path if we need to. In that direction, in that case they can. We can get the data that the county needs. But again, my bigger point is. We can get what we can get through the API is we're not going to be able to get the entire record the way the county sees it in next gen. Yeah, we don't need to be clear on you know they will have to scan things and upload them. You know all of those things would have to happen. Yeah. OK, so. So let's you know again harp on this and then see what we can. You know we we need to put a red line on the sand that he need to resolve this. Otherwise there's a this is going to read soon, right? In terms of delays, right? So if we delay this process is going to affect the I mean this is the crux of this entire implementation, right? Yeah. OK, so those are the things I had. Uhm, and. Uh, someone we have like 10 minutes. Maybe do you want to? Bring pull it up and then shares things that you have questions on or. Yeah, I can share. So for tomorrow. Tomorrow we are still doing the demo for the county. Is that correct? That's what we had discussed for like the second portion of this meeting that Chris was going to do a demo for them. When is this? Tomorrow. Remember, Ryan, we talked about this last week. So much has happened, I don't remember. Demo of what? Demo of the Dr. Cloud. So that's the Thursday call, though, too. That's the super user orientation. Do they want it twice? No, I thought that's super on Thursday. I thought that was the introduction into a configuration, not an actual demo of Dr. Cloud. So are they looking for a demo of Dr. Cloud to understand the system like we would have done in the sales process? So from my understanding, yes. So what I've gathered from all of this is that whoever elected Dr. Cloud did not inform or did not inform this team that we're currently working with. So from my understanding, IT would have been a part of that. The OCOO or OCOO at that time would have been a part of that. But none of that was communicated to the team that we're actually working with, which is why every conversation that we currently have keeps going back into you guys showing them how the system works, because they were never informed or included on any of the initial demos, which is why they keep asking for short demos in every meeting. All of our meetings kind of always go back to us, to you all showing them how the system works. So the last conversation we had last week was that in the second part of our project meeting that there was going to be a short demo of Dr. Cloud. In the Thursday meeting was the initial configuration meeting, which is the back end. One thing that they asked to steer away from is like security roles. And so they kind of hash out how they want to strategize that or if you guys have the ability to compress that. Now that we've gotten that ironed out, that's one thing, but kind of two separate things. Can I clarify for you, please, and the team? So yes, Chris can do a high level demo of Dr. Cloud on tomorrow's call, but that is for tomorrow's call is with the folks that we're providing weekly updates to, right? The management team. So if they have the right people involved on that call, fine. We can do a demo, but it won't be of their system because there's not enough data populated for us to do a meaningful demo. Chris will use the demo system and just kind of do the same high level demo he does for new prospects, right? We can do that. I want to emphasize the importance of Thursday's meeting because this is very unconventional for our team. Normally we kick off a project and we have weekly build and implementation calls the following week, okay? That's every implementation I have been a part of. And for some reason with the county, we're doing things like, which is good, having the requirements discussions, but we've not had one weekly build call yet. So on the Thursday's call, I want to set the expectation that we review the staging site with the right people who are going to be participating in the build over the course of the implementation. Chris is going to do, we call it super user training. That's our terminology and per our process. But if they don't want to use the term super users and they want to call those people admin or build folks, Chris will be doing an admin build orientation for that group so that he can go through. It's not the backend summer. There's nothing in the backend yet. Whatever, I mean, Neil might be putting in some information from the sheet, like around programs and locations and whatever else we've been given. But really it's to orient that group to the UI. Like here's the main parts of the application that you're going to need to be familiar with. And here's where we put in some data and here's the areas where we need you to do your parts and put in the rest of the data. Is that clear and makes sense to you? Yeah, it is clear. So I don't know what the confusion is, Ryan, though. In the last weekly meeting, there was Richard and Naz was there and they specifically said, hey, we have not seen a demo of Dr. Cloud. And I think you said, yeah, we can do it. Like instead of setting up another meeting, you said, hey, Chris can do it next week. So that's like, you know, and whatever demo system or sales demo you have, that should be fine. Sure. That's fine. Okay. Yeah. And the configuration build, you know, that meeting Thursdays, that is separate. And I think the county has already sent that email out with that list of people that they want. Right. And I think we should start having the meeting right somewhere. We are supposed to have this meeting this Thursday. Right. So while we are trying to kind of group like, you know, one of the questions they have is, hey, we don't want to give everybody access to everything. So while we are trying to do that, we should not postpone this meeting for that. Right. We can. Oh, no, I don't. I don't suggest that. Yeah. But I'm just saying, you know, also the county should not. And tomorrow's thing, we'll say, hey, this is like, you know, you're going to send that email out today, which will say, hey, we got this, you know, people list of people and, you know, different programs or areas that you want them involved. Now, this is the list of tasks you need to map this list of tasks in, you know, who you think are going to do this, which group of people are going to do this implementation task so that we can configure, meaning Dr. Cloud can configure their roles or their users access or ACL accordingly so that they only do things that you want them to do. Right. But that's like a separate thing. It's not going to happen by Thursday. We'll get that information and then, you know, Chris and Tim will set it up accordingly. Maybe it'll take a week or two weeks. Right. But we should start having these Thursday meetings to discuss what are the implementation tasks, how the system is set up currently, configured currently, and then people to just go in and start looking at them. And we can give them assignments like Brian talked about. Maybe not everybody in the group gets an assignment, maybe one assignment to, you know, billing, one assignment to, I don't know, IT. Right. Brian, is that what I just said? Yeah, makes sense. I just wanted to make sure we were clear on like, you know, the purpose of the meetings and what we really need to cover on Thursday. Okay. Which call are we talking about tomorrow? This is the weekly status call, Chris. Management status. Yeah. And then. Let's see in the books, Chris. It'll be at 11 o'clock your time, Chris. My time. Okay. Got it. Yeah. And I don't think you should plan more than 15 minutes, Chris. Oh, yeah. I mean, 15, 20 minutes. I mean, because usually it takes like, you know, people talk and then half an hour, but I don't think you should plan more than 15 minutes, 20 minutes of demo. And then you can leave some questions or whatnot. Right. Yeah. Some time for questions. Yeah. Actually, I think we want to limit that time on questions. Yeah. So we have like five minutes for questions or whatnot. And then part of the thing is when we are discussing in this workflow meetings, I know Chris is pulling up different screens and showing them how things will look like in DrCloud. So we are doing that regardless of anything else. Right. Because people are asking and we want to also show them how things are done. Right. And so tomorrow's meeting is just for education. Hey, what are the DrCloud, you know, thing that you have, how the workflow works at a very high level, how the maybe fiscal works. And maybe you want to focus a few minutes on fiscal as well, because the fiscal team, you know, had been asking for it. I mean, they're the chief complainers, I think, because they've been saying, hey, we have not seen it. We are not involved in the decision making process. So we just need to get everybody together. And then this Montgomery County is big. Right. So like you've probably seen this, like it's a liberal county. They have a huge budget. So there are a lot of programs and, you know, people or not. OK. Yeah. We're doing Memhill County right now as well in Oregon. They're huge as well. So and Chris has done Marion County and a bunch of other counties. He's got it. He's used to this. Yeah. OK, good. Anything else? Someone go ahead. No, not that I remember from last week, for the most part, we just need the you all just need the implementation, the task and the list mapped so that we can get this, the bill calls underway. I know that they're at CCDUOL on the invite. Which explains to them, so hopefully you don't have too many questions. I'm going into that meeting on Thursday, Tuesday. Tuesday, we'll try to minimize the project status stuff so Chris has time. Your last item here is somewhere on the list, like this last line item in the table. I don't know if it's a risk, right? It's just a task. It's not a risk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just something. So you can put it into activities. Yeah. I was going to say let's move that to just tasks. Yeah, task, right? Yeah, and then if you want to add in this one that the project plan is published. So the only person who definitely want to see the project plan is Richanne. So is there a way I would forward this email or this Smartsheet to her and then you'd have to create access to her? Or I mean, let me add her, but my caution with doing that is her clicking the request edit button and then automatically getting a license to her. I don't know. Okay, let's not do that then. Yeah, I think we need to stick to keeping access to the Smartsheet between us and doing the export to the county to keep things from not getting messed up on our side. Okay, so then the version of the Spreadsheet that you shared with Somar and us, that we can load it into the county side saying, hey, this is the most recent plan, right? Yeah, so Neil is already doing that every Friday afternoon. Oh, okay. I've created an older plan. If you look on the SharePoint site, I created a folder to archive the older version. So week over week, the new one will be there. The link to the dashboard is there, so anybody can get there. Okay, so this is, where is it? Underneath the Siteplant folder. Yeah, and then project, oh, Siteplant. Planning. Maybe planning, yeah. Project plan. Okay. And then you'll see older plan versions. The URL is live, so anybody can click the URL for the dashboard. Okay. And that'll load. They'll reach on and everyone can look at that. Okay. That's open to everyone who has that link. On the right side, we'll have Neil's weekly status that you see in the table, so people will know. That's what we'll review on the weekly calls, the status calls. And then if you just scroll down, there's two important tables. One is, thanks, Ramesh. One is tracking towards milestone completion, and then the other one is any tasks at risk. And the logic for tasks at risk is, which is good, it shows like this. If a task has a start date that is in the past, then it, or I'm sorry, maybe an end date. One of the two. Whichever date shows up in the past, then it shows up on this table. So this is how people will know any area that we need to catch up on, or is at risk, or we need to throw resources at. Makes sense? Yes, absolutely. So somewhere, if you can put this link in your PowerPoint, and then once you're done with the activities, you know, thing, or you can put this in the activities slide as well, so that you can say, hey, there is, by the way, the project plan is already there, and you can just click on this. And this is a way for you to kind of see what details, you know, of the tasks that we are doing on some level of detail, right? Not exactly. Do I still have access to this? Everybody has access to this. Everybody does. Anyone who has that link? Yeah, so this is the link. Oh, OK, got it. All right. Thank you. Yeah. OK, yeah. And then the project plan, is this the one, the more recent? This is, I had pasted this three days ago. Is there an updated version of the spreadsheet? No, Neil is going to go through it today, because we do our scorecard review. So he'll go through it today, and then we'll just plan on Friday. We'll have a new version up. That's going to be our process. Every Friday afternoon, we're going to load the new one in. Understood. OK, makes sense. Yeah. OK, then, thank you for your time. And then, Summer, if you want any questions, if you have any questions, just reach out to me in finalizing the weekly report tomorrow. Got it. Thank you. Thanks. Bye-bye. Yeah, thank you all. Bye-bye. Bye.",
