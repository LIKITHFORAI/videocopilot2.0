  "text": "How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. Good. It's been a long Monday already. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. Did Tess confirm that she would be joining? Yeah. She's in the waiting room right now. Perfect. No, I don't know. I know Joseph is supposed to be on, too, but he might be a bit late. Okay. Hello. How are you, Tess? It's Monday. I feel you. Good afternoon, Tess, Taylor, Anu, Sam. This is D.B.G. How are you doing? Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. All right, Anu. Yeah? We are taking them through the billing process. The billing rules that you set up? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Get started and I'll jump in. Okay. So, I do have a list of things that I would love to see. Yeah, absolutely. Name them out. That would be a great start. Okay. So, where do claims go when providers have done everything they need to do and they're ready to be submitted? Okay. Okay. Let me share my screen. Sorry. If I don't put this piece up, then I miss anybody who tries to join. Okay. So, no, sorry. Billing. So, this is after, like, they've fixed everything that they need to fix. There's no errors? Correct. Anu, it's claims rules, right? No, it's billing rules. So, once the encounters, once the clinicians are done with their... Actually, would you guys mind if we... Is this being recorded right now? It is, yes. Perfect. Okay. All right. So, once the clinicians are done with their part, they've completed the notes, they've checked it, and then they've closed it. So, your workflow is going to include having your clinicians close the encounters out when they're done with their part of it. So, what closing of the encounters does is when, you know, and it's just a button, a click in Dr. Cloud that once they've finished reviewing their encounters, they say, okay, they're ready to close the encounter. Close the encounter just says that now, you know, it's ready for billing. So, in that case, also, the process of closing the encounter triggers the billing rules. These are rules that are set up in the system to, you know, based on the various criteria, if you have to add modifiers, if you have to change a code based on what pair it goes to, you know, based on the credential of your clinicians, it has to go out with a specific code. Or if it's time-based where, you know, for a certain, you know, beyond a certain time, it changes its code. These are for the E&M codes and all. So, those are rules that we set up in the billing rules, and those rules get run on the encounter. The encounter, when the billing rules is run, the, you know, the rules are processed to see that if there's any criteria on the encounter that matches with the rules that is set, and if they find that match, then the rule as set up in the billing rules then applies to the encounter. What that means is then the fee sheet gets changed with the actual code and the modifiers, et cetera, that it needs to be submitted to the payer with. So, that's the process that happens. Once that is completed, the encounters are closed, then those encounters will show up in your billing queue. This billing manager is where your billing queue shows up. And then, you know, there's various filters to filter out how you want to see those claims. Any questions? Yes, I have many. Ask away. So, okay, we would have to filter between locations. And we have the filter to filter locations. So, are there any claims in here right now that I could? Okay, so we filter between locations, and then would all claims show up in there? Like every single claim, no matter the insurance company, they would show up in here. Yeah, so everything based on this first step, right, available search criteria, this has a lot of filters. You can filter by location. You can filter by pairs. You can filter by dates of services. And you can also filter by service codes. So, you know, based on what your billing process is, and if you bill out every week, say, this is just an example I'm throwing up. If you submit your claims once a week, and, you know, you basically bill out one location at a time, then you can set it up to say, you know, I want to see all the claims from this date of service to this date of service out of, say, your location A. So, it gives you that. So, I mean, the more filters you apply or the more search criteria you define, the smaller your queue is going to be. So, we submit claims daily per location multiple times. Can we see what a claim actually looks like in this system that we would be scrubbing to make sure everything is actually correct? Yeah. So, you see a billing rule over here. We can also set up over here. I do see some golden thread errors. But depending on what the golden thread error is, and this one should not be preventing billing. But there are golden threads or rules that you can set up in the system that can block an encounter form from being billed when it does not meet the rule criteria. Having said that, in this case, the last one, the last encounter, I mean, all three of them are ready. I see that they're not ready to be billed at all because the first two don't have a diagnosis code. So, what I typically do, and then it also basically, we've set up criteria for blocking an encounter from being billed. So, if you can see on the right over here, the little square boxes that you see to select this encounters for creating the claim, that's grayed out. That means that you cannot select these encounters. You cannot generate the claims for these encounters because, well, one of the first things I did notice was that there's no diagnosis code in those encounters. Okay, so normally when we come across claims like these that do have issues, we send them to Maya to correct. Would these stay in here, or is there a way to send them directly to Maya with a note, these have to be corrected? Or do we send them directly to the provider, or will they stay in here, like in a bucket? Right, there's a couple of things over here. We can also, we also have a setting in the system where these two claims won't even show up in this queue if they're not complete, right? So, that all depends on the criteria that you've set for a clinician to close the encounter. Now, we can include in that criteria to prevent a clinician from closing the encounter if there's no diagnosis code in it. So, you know, they'll go try and close the encounter. The system's not going to let them. It's going to throw up an alert that says, hey, you don't have a diagnosis code. And hopefully, you know, that's when they'll fix it right there. And so, and in that process, you won't see these claims. I don't know if that's been set up in the system yet, but looks likely not because these two are showing up. But to answer your question, Taylor, if for some reason. They're still open. They're still open, yeah. Those are open claims, yeah. But that's open because that form is not completed and service codes are not justified. Well, we probably will need to go and check in the globals also if that service codes justification is set up to prevent it from closing an encounter. So, Tess, are you here, Tess? Tess? I'm here. Sorry, it took me forever to find the mute. Oh, you're fine. So, I'm questioning. So, if there is issues with claims and they, wherever they sit for the clinician to correct, is that going to be. Like, I know Maya's really good at fixing things that need to be fixed. So, if these are sitting with certain clinicians to fix, do you think that that will be a timely thing or do you think that they will fix them? I think in the beginning it won't be very timely because they're going to have to be getting used to the system, but we can train them as to that. Okay. So, when, I guess this might be for me and Tess. So, say the ones that have the golden thread rules that are kind of highlighted that we cannot submit, where do those go? In certain clinicians' buckets or how do, how are the clinicians aware that there's issues with what they need to get done? There are reports that they could pull. And also, if you're in here, show incompleted forms. It'll show them all of their incompleted forms. But also, if you're training them, they won't be able to close an encounter for it to bill until everything's completed. So, if you're training them at the beginning that, hey, you need to close this every single time, then they would have to fix that before they could close it. Okay. That would be more of a Tess thing, like this is doable or not doable. I'm more looking at, because what we do right now, all claims are put into a ready-to-submit bucket. Those we scrub to make sure they're correct. And if they're not correct, we send to Maya, who corrects them. So, I'm just curious on the golden thread ones that have that yellow triangle that they cannot be submitted. Will those stay in there, or is there, like, notifications for the providers to fix them, that type of stuff? So, Taylor, there are two types of those golden, you know, two types of golden triangles that you'll see. One is that, you know, rules have not been met, but these rules will not prevent you from submitting the claims to the peer. And those might be, you know, rules that say that somebody is due for their plan of care review or something like that. That should not impact the current encounter that needs to be submitted, right? So, that's one. So, you will see those golden triangles, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they, you know, they cannot be billed. What's going to drive that is if the rules are set up appropriately in the system, it's a little checkbox on the right side that's going to allow you to generate a claim for that or not. So, if it blocks you from generating a claim, and that means that that little checkbox is grayed out, then that claim is not yet ready, because that golden thread then likely was preventing the claim from being created. But, you know, there might be other rules that that's perfectly okay for you to generate the claim for. Okay. Sam, can we go to a claim that is potentially ready to be submitted? Okay. Yeah. The first thing we do, what I do when I look at that is just eyeball it, right? So, over here, I can see that the payer is in there. Can we see who the rendering, supervising, and billing people are? Like, can you open that and actually see what is in the claim itself? Yes. So, over here, you know, the rendering is – yeah, let – Sam, just go ahead and generate the claim. Yeah, okay. So, before you would even do that, you would run the claims error check, but over here, it seems like everything passed. But then we would want to make sure on our end that the supervising, billing, and rendering provider are what is needed. Okay. And as well as looking at the progress note to make sure everything is needed – everything that's needed is in the progress note. So, do you – Yeah, can I ask – may I ask a question? Yeah. So, for the progress note, do you go into every encounter that you're billing to make sure that it has everything it needs or – Yeah, we do. Okay. All right. So, then – and then you have to have every progress note that goes out. You have to have a rendering provider NPI as well as a supervising provider NPI. So, every note has to have two signatures? Three, actually. Rendering, supervising, and billing. Or let me pull one up. Right, that's already three. Yeah. So, that's three. And then we make sure that the progress note matches the actual claim. And say if we're billing an MCO with a T1040, if the progress note does not have the T1040 in it, we send it back for them to update the progress note. Yeah, so all that, the addition of the T1040, et cetera, will be done via the billing rules. So, when they close the encounter, for Medicaid claims or CCBHC claims, the system will, when it runs the rule, it will add the T1040 code to that charge sheet. And so, the claim will be generated with the T1040. So, that's where the billing rules will play an important role to get the claims in the state where they can be submitted to the peer in the form that the peer requires. Okay. So, basically, if the billing rules are set up correctly, we would not have to open every claim to make sure that everything is correct. Correct. I mean, you know, I would still encourage in the beginning, do that for a few. But once that, you know, you have the confidence that things are working smoothly, then you don't really need to. You can, you know, essentially just, the billing queue will be your review, you know. I mean, that will be the place where you quickly review what's there, what's not there. And the other thing is also just before you generate the claim, we have our own version of the scrubber where it's that check claim errors. Sam, can we get out of this so that you can show? So, the claim error check. So, you'd select all those claims that, I mean, the encounters that are ready to be billed and run the claims errors check. This is going to, you know, this will scrub that claim based on the rules that we've set up. So, this is where the claims rule. So, we have two types of rules. One is when the encounter gets closed, that's the billing rules. It basically gets your encounters with the coding that's needed for it to submit successfully. When you're actually generating the claim, the system runs the claims rules. The claims rules are essentially a mapping between, it's a mapping between what needs to go in the claim and each of, you know, where it needs to pull from. And that's where, that's how the claim will get generated. I do see Joseph had a question. Hi, Joseph. I knew. I hope you're well. Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted to place a caveat on some of those claims rules functionalities and not needing to go in and check the claims. I agree with your approach of just kind of spot checking those at first and then becoming less and less frequent with the spot checks. With the exception of any claims that are multiple payers, I think that those are still a good idea to go in and check to make sure that those are all formatted correctly. So, if you have somebody on private insurance and Medicaid, just ensuring that those all are populating correctly, especially with the rendering provider. So, just that caveat. Sorry to interrupt. Thank you. No, that's fine. Okay, well, thank you for that. So, we just have to make sure billing rules are set up. And if there's changes, we would have to update the billing rules as necessary. Okay. Okay. Next question on my list was ERAs. Where do those come in? Those also come in. So, Sam, if you click on ERA process report. Yeah. So, this is where all you'll see once they come in, you know, you'll see a list of all the ERAs that have come in. Again, you can filter them by dates when we receive them. when they've come in. So you can, you know, you can, those from date and to date, you can also choose to filter them by the insurer pair, by adding an insurance over there. If you don't, you know, add any filters, and if you take the from date to when you first started with the system, it's going to give you all the, and there's nothing in the to date, it'll give you all the ERAs that we have received so far. You can also check, you can also search by a check number. So if you want to see if a check number is included in any of the ERAs, you can use the check number filter. And then if you have a claim ID, and the claim ID is generally created when you generate the claim, each claim will have its own ID that you'll see in the claim manager. So if you want to, you know, you want to check if a particular claim has gotten paid, you can add the claim ID in there and it'll give you the ERA that is, that you have received. Now the system, when we receive the ERAs, we upload it from, I mean, we pull them from your clearing house. We pull them from the clearing house, we process them, and we post those payments to the encounters. And then, you know, if there are errors, and some of you update the claims manager with whatever the status of each of those, the claims are based on what we received in the ERA. Okay, so would we be hitting search, and then I was really kind of hoping to see like, kind of test everything. So there would be stuff in here right now. Yeah, I mean, we can already see, I mean, if we go to the claims manager, let's go to claims manager, and you can see, I think Sam's already generated one claim, right, Sam? Yeah. Yeah, so there's a claim that's been generated. If you open that, that's your, you know, that's the version of the claim, a readable version of the claim. We actually generate an 837 that we submit to the peer, but this is a representation of that 837. Okay, so when ERAs come in, is that automatically posted, or do we click on it and hit post, or how does that work? It automatically posts. So if the system, it just, it's a background thing. Every night it checks to see if there's any ERA available to download, and then it pulls that ERA, it runs the ERA, it posts that ERA, and then in the morning when you come in, and you'll see, you know how, you can check to see whether it could post all the, you know, all the payments that have come in, or all the transactions that have come in, and see where, you know, it gives you a clear indicator of how, what could be, what was posted, what it could not post, and the reason why it wasn't posted. So I don't know if the demo system will have that. So is there a way to not let it post automatically? Only because we are having issues with certain MCOs that the MCO will have a different remit than what Waystar is pulling in. Okay, so we can set up the system to not post, just pull in the ERA and not post, but when you're ready to post, you know, you might have to delete that ERA that was posted and then upload it. We do give you, you know, we do have a way to, we do have a manual way to upload the ERA too. So we capture the ERA over here in the download button over there on the right side. So you can basically copy it to your computer and then upload it. We don't have, currently we don't have something that, you know, you say, it just pulls it and then it sits there, and then you just select them and say post, but that's something I'm hearing more from. So I will, you know, I'll add a ticket in the system to allow you to do that. So you don't have to do that manual downloading and uploading, but currently, yes, we can prevent, we can set up, set your system up so that it doesn't automatically post. Okay, another question. MCOs only allow one visit per day. We have to bill every visit, even if there's three in one day. Is there a way to set up the system to, because when we're manually posting, we are able to write off the multiple service same day visits as we're manually doing that. Is there a way to set up the system to catch, okay, one visit paid, we need to write off the other two. Yeah, we can do that. That's again, billing rules. And that, so that's why it'll be very important that we get all these rules. We have a representative, we understand all these rules so that we can set it up when we're setting up those billing rules. So in this case, are you talking about your CCBHCs where the addition, it's only one encounter, the T1040 gets billed out for only one, one of those encounters and everything else, the shadow codes are all zero. The rest of them are all zero. No, we currently bill out every visit for every patient. One will pay and then the rest will be denied if they were seen more than one time in the day. Right, so in DrCloud, you could set, if it is CCBHC service, you could set it up. Okay, I let Joseph answer that. Joseph, were you going to answer this? Oh yeah, I was Anu. So what's going to happen with those ones, Taylor, is it's essentially going to merge any of those multiple claims underneath one encounter. So it's only going to bill for that singular T1040, and then it's going to combine all of the CCBHC shadow build codes underneath that singular encounter. And then it'll populate with the respective, you know, rendering and referring providers for each one of those lines. Okay. Okay. So it's going to take that manual process that go through and scrub those, because there's logic that we can build in. I think that one's via the claims rules that's going to essentially roll up any of those same day services for the same person into a singular encounter. But we would still be billing the insurance, correct? Yes, yes. Yeah, it'll still bill insurance, but yeah. And so those are, and all of these billing rules are all insurance specific. So earlier, Taylor, you had mentioned how certain RAs are only coming through from certain MCOs. And so if there's certain nuances that one of the plans wants for the CCBHC claims, we can make that specific to that insurance. Okay. All right. Okay. I guess we can move forward to my next question. How would you be posting payments manually? Like for claims that are not posted through the system, how would we post a payment manually? So we have the payment screen over there. Go to the payment screen. Okay, this is where you'll post the payment. So that new payment button is what will be used to post that payment. So you'll click on the new payment. And then this will basically ask you for the date of entry defaults to today's date, because that's when you're posting that payment, whether it's a check payment or the type of payment, what was the payment method, whether it was a check payment, a credit card payment, an insurance payment, or what have you. That little payment method has the drop down. And, oh, this is just credit card. The electronic is what you want to use if it's an insurance payment, or if the insurance sent you a check, then, you know, check payment. And then if there's a check number, that check referral number is what you can keep to track that payment. Payment amount is the amount that you received. And then payment entity is where you'll suggest. The insurance? Yes, Sam, can you move to the payment entity drop down? It's behind that, yeah. So it's either the insurance payment, client payment, or it's a co-pay. Okay, so then, yeah, go ahead, sorry. No, no, no, go ahead. Stop me. So then when you hit save payment, would that allow you to pull up each and every? Yes, the client. Yeah, so it depends, right? If you're doing insurance claim, then, and if it's an insurance payment, then, and if you do save payment, it'll pull up all the clients that have outstanding balances for that particular payer. So, I mean, you know, they have services that have balances for that particular payer. Okay, so would, when you get to that point, can you search particular claim numbers? Yes, claim numbers are, you can search, you can search via the check number. Okay, but I'm just talking like, like right now, with our system that we're using, when we manually post, we can manually put in the claim numbers, and then it pops up, we post the payment for that particular patient. You can, payment for, it says just for a particular patient. Well, I'm just saying, well, we have to manually post a lot right now, and that's fine, like we have the workflow to do that, but it would just, so if we are posting like a $70,000 payment from Medicaid, and it pops up like all the patients that we're waiting on payment for, for Medicaid, that's fine, we're waiting on payment for, for Medicaid, that could be very, take a long time, I guess is what I'm saying, and I would just love to see it like working in action. Yeah, we don't have any payments or anything in the system. I know. Yeah. Okay, well, all right, we can move on to the next one. When we, when you guys, when we get rejected claims or denials, where do those go? Two places, there's a couple of places it goes to, it goes in the claims manager under the status, so Sam, if you could go to the claims manager, and pull up that claim that is there, just search, yeah. So there's that two things, if it is, so rejected, there are two types of rejections, if it was rejected in the clearinghouse, because something, you know, their scrub caught something that we missed, then the second status column over here, where it now says created, when you submit the claim, it'll say submitted, and then if you receive the 277 responses back, and if it has rejections in it, it'll give you the rejected over there and give you the reason for rejection. If the denials have come via an ERA, then that, the settlement column in the end over there, that will have the denial, you know, it'll have it as denied claim, and then it also sometimes, based on how it comes in the ERA, it'll also have, if it's one of the standard CMS denial reasons, it'll also put it out there, or it might just say denied claim, and the denials manager will have more information, so we do have a denials manager, which has all the denials that comes in through the ERA, or any rejections or denials that come in, and then you just process the denial queue, basically. If we were to post a payment manually and put it to denied with the code, would those go to the denials manager? Depends on where you put the code. If you put it in the settlement status, then yes, it will go into the denials manager. And then, okay, if they're in the denials manager, how would we pull up, if you open a claim that was denied, how do you pull up the actual remit to see what the full reason is, if it was manually posted? So if it were, oh, yeah, okay, if it was manually posted, then, if you manually, did that remit get processed via Dr. Cloud? No, right? Is the remit, does the remit exist in Dr. Cloud, is what I wanted to say. Well, in our current system, we upload the remits to each payment that we post manually. So when we go to the denied bucket, quote, unquote, we're able to pull that remit from that specific claim. So this is the paper EOBs you're talking about, Taylor? Yes. Okay. Not paper. Well, I guess you could consider it paper if we're pulling it from- It's a PDF? It's a PDF. Yes. Okay. So I just wonder where those go for us to actually work the denials, because I'm sure you could recognize that there's so many payments, so many claims. So we have different people on different tasks, one working denials, one posting payments, and one doing whatever else needs to be done. I'm just curious where, if we manually post- Let me revert. Yeah, I'll have to revert on this one, where we can store those EOBs. Usually, I mean, currently we don't store those EOBs anywhere. It's the PDF that you have. It's not in DrCloud. What we do store is the 835s that we receive, the electronic EDIs that we receive, the ERAs that we receive. Okay. Yeah, so I'll talk to my team and get back on that one. Okay, that answers that question. So I would like to look at reporting for, like, month end if we were to pull a report to see how many payments were posted by a specific person at the end of the month or how many claims were submitted for a specific payer for a given week. Okay. Go to the financials. Can you say the first one again, Taylor? So end of the month, if we wanted to look at how many payments were posted per insurance company by a particular user. For the whole month, like payments posted. Yeah. Or payments received. Okay, payments received. But from a specific person posting those. No, I think the payments received from the insurance, we can go to the payments thing, the payment screen, the billing payments, yeah. And so over here, you can essentially say insurance and payment from will be the insurance names of particular insurance. If you're trying to see how many payments we've received from a particular payer, then essentially you'd have the payment method or payment category with the insurance. Could you filter by who actually posted the payment? I don't know if we have that currently. Payment received by. Do that, pull that in. Yeah, yeah, so you could. That's added. I have not seen it previously, so that's a new one. Good. Yes, so to answer your question, you could. Okay, and then what about if I wanted to know how many claims were submitted for Medicaid for a week? Is that. Well, yeah, that could be. But it is not a payment. It's you just want to know. Yes, so it's not in the payment screen. That would be your claims manager. Your claims manager will give you clearly how many payments for a particular. So essentially it all depends on how you use the current criteria. So the claim date will be last week, say maybe this week right from Monday through Friday. And then the claim status will be submitted. And your clearinghouse is optional. You don't have to have that clearinghouse. And then that will give you all the claims that were submitted on the in that particular week. OK. And you can CSV. You can CSV it also once you get the report. And you can print it out to Excel. OK. Does that report show contractual adjustments, denied claim count, unposted payment count, anything like that potentially? No, this is just your claims manager, right? This one will just show you how many claims were submitted and what those claims were. OK, well, I'm just talking about what I run weekly. And that's kind of what I need to see. If a report will show what we submitted for all insurances, the contractual adjustments after we've posted payments, denied claim count, unposted payment count, and write-off adjustments. Yeah, there's a couple of reports. There's the net revenue report. There's the billed claim reports. So I would potentially have to run five different reports to get all of these. I'm going to try and give you one report that gets a lot of these information. So bear with me. I'm kind of concerned if Taylor's having to pull five reports to get something done, though. Yeah. We had a billed claims report, right? Do these guys have that? I think we built it for another client that has. Yeah, I just don't know if it's been enabled. Yeah, in this one, right? Yeah. I don't know if it's that one. One, or if it's a custom report, we built a custom report, Sam. Yeah. We need to enable that on their site and see if that report will meet Taylor's needs. Yeah. Taylor, can you send us those criteria, the information that you're looking for in the report, and we'll try and- Yeah, I believe I've sent it already, but I will send it again. There's just a lot of little things here and there, and billing insurance is very important. I'm not very pleased at the moment with what I'm seeing, and especially with reporting and then the insurance billing stuff. So who should I send it to? So you guys could look further into it. Yes, Sam. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just saying, and I really appreciate Dr. Cloud and everything, but from where we are right now, like it's so easy to do everything, like in two or three screens, rather than having to flip back and forth through many screens or me pulling five reports every week. So I will get you guys the list of what I need, and I apologize. I was just thinking that we were actually gonna see a demo with a lot of claims to see how claims should be submitted and where to go, and you guys have done the best you can. I know that. I just, I'm not, I'm sorry. I will get you guys the list of what I need in reporting, and when it comes to claims being ready to be submitted and if claims are sitting that should be submitted in clinician's buckets for them to fix, I'm just concerned that they may not be fixed in a timely manner, like with the process that we have now. Yeah, I would be a little concerned with that too. Yeah. Especially since we're gonna be throwing a whole EHR at them to get them on point with reviewing and fixing those claims. Like we don't have those issues really right now. And so if they're not fixing them quick enough, then that loses the revenue for our company, and we can't do that. So if you were to open a claim, like would we be able to fix what we know we can fix? My team, my billing team. Like we wouldn't be able to update anything, correct? The provider would have to update it. Well, it depends on the level of permissions that you assign. Yeah. And then it's also dependent upon what you're wanting to change within any of those claims. I think that the other important thing here is that like a lot of the processes that are now being manually performed within ECW are now going to be automated within DrCloud. And so as a result of that, it's going to kind of change the workflow of those things. So in order for a claim to be checked, the claims rules and the billing rules both need to apply to that claim before you're going to want to go in and change any of it. Once you go in and change anything within that fees sheet or within the 837P, then it's going to override any of those claims and billing rules that were set to run because the system thinks, oh, you don't want it to go through the standard flow. We want to go in and interrupt that process. So then once you begin a manual process within that overarching process, it requires every step forward to be manual as well. Does that make sense? It makes sense. It just seems like very, very, a lot more difficult than what we're doing right now. But again, I defer to TESS and it's just, I guess it's TESS trusting the providers to get everything done correctly when there's things here and there that need to be corrected. I defer to TESS. I have a hard time leaving it up to the clinicians. I mean, I have a hard time getting their notes finished as it is. So what's the process today, TESS and Taylor? The process today, well, TESS, you correct me if I'm wrong. There's a bucket ready to submit for each location. We check each claim to make sure it's correct. We update the claim if it's not, and we check the progress note to make sure that the progress note has what it needs. If we cannot correct the claim ourselves, we send it back to Maya for her to correct or get with the clinician, and she gets it done quickly. So there's like buckets for everything, which is nice. And I'm just- Categories. Categories, yes, that's the correct term. Thank you, TESS. But then posting payments also, we know that certain payers that come in in an ERA form, we cannot post because in their system, it's different than what comes through ERA-wise. So we do most manually, and then we're able to write off claims at the time of posting, so they're not sitting in wherever they're taking care of at the time of posting the payments that we do manually. And then there's different areas of denials. There's different areas for rejections that we work daily, and we submit multiple times per day claims. So yes, that's what I have to say. Wow. So I don't do a lot of the billing. When it comes to billing stuff, Taylor's my guru when it comes to that, Taylor and Maya. But what we need to have for the billing is it needs to be efficient and smooth for them. So they need to be able to, like Taylor's saying, instead of a bucket or a category, it's each claim is set up and ready to go, but it doesn't submit until Taylor can take a look at it, make sure that it's correct. If it's not correct, she needs to be able to kick it to a different staff, whether it's Maya, and Maya kicks it down to our clinicians. We can do that, but leaving it up to the clinician and putting it in their box just to hopefully get to, I can tell you right now, that's not gonna happen. I mean, I have to chase them as it is to get certain notes locked and blocked and done so that Taylor can even bill for them. So I don't know if like you guys need to see how we do it on ECW and kind of work with that process, but I know that billing side works for Taylor very well. Yes. Sure, I mean, you can show us what you're set up and we'll see how we can set up the system. I mean, Taylor, if your preference is for the posting, et cetera, to be done manually so that you have control over that, we can definitely set up the system to not post anything automatically. So then the posting will have to be manually done. Right, not only one portion of like the five other portions, which is why I'm concerned, with our current system, like you can open up a claim and easily, like very easily correct. Yeah, and we can do that in our system also. Hey, Sam, can you open that claim that you just created? No, the claim, yeah. No, it's not submitted, it was created. Okay, open the claimer. Okay, now this is an editable file. And if you need to change that, the service lines are those that 24, the field 24, it's the dates of service, the place of service, that's the service line. And then your 32 is a service location, your 33 is the billing location, the 32A is the NPI, the billing group NPI is a 33A. All those can be changed in this form. And then if you scroll all the way down, then you can submit it right from here. So, you know, it's, yeah. So that, you submit it, that's when it submits it, you know, it submits the 830, the 837 and goes to the PIN. Kath, am I allowed to share my screen on one patient? No, absolutely. Yeah, I would say yes, because they have a bunch of our patient information already, so. Okay, I'm just sharing one, and I'm just showing you guys how simple it is right now. This, that screen looks very. What are? Yeah, so I just tried. Can you guys see my screen or no? No. Nope, I tried. Oh, here we go. All right, so this is what a claim looks like when we open it. And you could see billing rendering supervisor. We could update these ourselves right here. The CPT codes, we could look at the progress note to make sure the T1040 is in there. If the T1040 is not in there, then we would send it back. This is not signed, so this would go back to Maya, and then Maya would get Kelly to sign it. So it's just, this is more user-friendly rather than having to open up the whole screen with multiple boxes to. Hey, Sam, I think what, we can also show them the fee sheet. I think that's the equivalent of what was just shown. Right, before you create the. Yeah, that's already. Yeah, that's how you preview the claim, is within the fee sheet rather than generating a claim. Right. I don't know that it shows the progress note within the fee sheet, though. Not within the fee sheet, not within the fee sheet, but it's part of it. I think there's a link to it, right? Yeah. Yeah. But you guys see how easy it is? Within a claim, we can open the progress note. We could update the claim in one screen. Like we don't have to go to multiple different areas to correct or see something. It's one screen. Sam, show the encounter itself. That's all within the encounter, right? So from the billing manager, you can access that. Yeah. And it stays in the same screen. So this is the fee sheet. You can change the rendering, supervisor, referring. There's the charges, the number of units. The note's on there, too. You click on the note, and it'll open that. Where's the note at? It's the one that says note. Oh. The notes and the encounter. Yeah. See, but that's not what they're looking for. They would be looking for the billing code. Can you go to the fee sheet, Sam? Yeah, the note's right there underneath note. You can click that open. Over next to provider on the H0001 line. Okay, so from this screen, can you open up the progress note? Not on this screen. I mean, it's part of the same encounter. Sam, go on the top and see. That, yeah. Okay, it just says. Click reopen encounter. That'll just reopen it. So if you go to the billing screen and click on a claim, can you, from that screen- Yeah, you can- Can you open the progress note to check to make sure that everything is there. It needs to be there. You can do this one, the note, and then you can preview the client encounter and it'll tell you what is all here, the address, billing location, all of that. But it's not signed by the provider. Well, if that note has to be signed by the provider, yeah, it's- Every note has to be signed. No, no, no. I'm talking about the client encounter. So every note that you have has these two forms in it. One is the form that has all the encounter information and the other one is a note itself, right? The note itself, if that's what's signed by the provider, then the note will have that signature piece. If you require that the client encounter also have a signature and they also have to sign that with all that information, then we can enable a signature on that form too. Okay. Well, I guess I will send you guys the requirements for what I need for reporting. But I will be quite honest with you guys that I'm not super excited about the billing process. I'm a very honest person. I'm just putting that out there. Not super excited. Well, I think what we'll need to do is once we set this thing up and we have a few encounters, then just taking you through the billing workflow will help, at least hopefully, will change your mind a little bit. We'll see. So once that's set up. Billing rules. We need to have more. Sorry, Sam, that's yours, please. Billing rules. We have to update the claim rules. The rest of the insurances need to be put in. Hello? Can you hear me? I can now. Oh, sorry. The rest of the insurances need to be added. Billing rules need to be finished. And then the claim rules need to be updated. So is there a way to make it so that it is simpler for Taylor or is this kind of just the way it is? Because I understand, you know, the way that we have it in ECW. And like, I get it. I've seen our claims in ECW. It's very simple for us. It's all right there in front of us. But there's certain things that are not in that client encounter that Taylor and Maya need. And it needs to be something that it's a fast click so that they can process as many as possible instead of having to search around. And right now it kind of looks searching around and we're not able to do that. Like, I mean, it's, we don't have the time. Are your clinicians supposed to finish their notes while they're in session? They're supposed to finish them right after their session. So they have up to 24 hours. And I will say that notes are typically finished but there are issues that we see within claims, which that's why they go back to Maya. But like Tess was saying, and I have been saying, it's so easy within one claim to see everything, not have to do so many clicks to find everything. Anya? Anya? You know, what I will say is that a lot of the steps that you're doing today manually, Taylor, you may not need to do that in Dr. Cloud. Once you've set up your rules, your claim rules and your billing rules, you know, a lot of that manual task will be moved at that point. But I agree. I agree with you 100%, but there's also like... Just things that you don't necessarily trust 100%, so it's, I think that manual is better at this point right now with what we're dealing with. And I was just hoping that today's demo was going to show like actual working flow, not just what is in our current setup right now, but it's difficult because from what I've seen today, I'm not 100% set on Dr. Cloud. And that's, that's kind of, in order for Dr. Cloud to work for us correctly, we all got to be able to be confident. And it makes me a little bit scared that we can't see the process and I get that it's still staging. I get that. They're all fake accounts. I get that. But at the same time, we have to be able to see a step by step, like from beginning to end and where it pops back with a error or anything like that. So Taylor knows what to anticipate. Like right now, she can literally do ECW like the back of her hand. And we got that there would be a change in an update and, you know, it would look a little different, but it can't be harder to use. And I know that Joseph was trying to get me a demo with someone who was actually like using Dr. Cloud. That didn't work out, which I understand, but it would be great if we could get like three referrals from clients that are currently using you guys so we could see their pros and cons, whatever. It's just so hard because if we're going to keep moving forward, we kind of want to know that it is an actual good thing. I'd love to speak to someone who actually does billing within Dr. Cloud that is a client or referrals are great. Just at this point, it's just difficult for me to say, yes, this is the one because what we're using right now is just simplified. It's very quick, very easy. I could pull one report for all things that I need and that's it. So, that's where I'm at, but I appreciate everyone's time. I was just hoping for a little bit more. In-depth. Yeah. Well, we haven't even got to the in-depth pieces of these. We've just been setting up the system. And so, I'm going to be sending out things in the MS Teams and emails that are things that on the project plan that still need to be done, whether that be on our side or whether that be on your guys' side. And then we'll be going through the workflows. We'll be going through the clinical workflows, the billing workflows, the front-end workflows, all of those workflows, the clinical workflows. Okay. Well, I appreciate seeing what I saw on the billing end today. And we did meet with Joseph a week or so ago in regards to adding insurances. I unfortunately will not be able to help out with adding the insurances. I apologize, Sam. No, you're fine. Okay. Yeah. I feel like doing that spreadsheet took a lot of time in itself. So, I guess we will just touch bases, Tess? Yeah. Okay. All right. And I'll talk to Ramesh and see what we can do about your questions with other customers and the billing system. Yeah. I'd love to see references from other people that use Dr. Cloud. That'd be great. Okay. I will talk to Ramesh and see what we can do. Sounds good. Okay. I will see you guys tomorrow. Thank you. All right. All right. Bye.",
