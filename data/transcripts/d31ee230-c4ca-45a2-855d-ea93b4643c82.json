  "text": "moving forward. In the meantime, this time that we're meeting today is to go over the workflows in NextGen to find out, to show our Dr. Cloud partners exactly the workflows that you're currently using in NextGen. And I will pass the mic to Dr. Numbart. Good morning. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks for joining. You're the only two that's... Oh, hey, Kim. Hi, Kim. I was just looking who is from the public health side that's going to take me in. So thank you all for joining this morning. So we've been going through a few of these today. Okay, we've got Beatrice finally. Okay. We're trying to kind of get to the exact information. I know we had a conversation before and that was on just your complete business process. This is kind of the next step in, okay, data for data, where do you put things in NextGen? So Kim, do you know who will take the reins? Kind of show us how you do the work in the actual system and where you put in the data and what type of data you put in. And if we have some time, the Dr. Cloud team will also show a big snippet of the actual new system and where you'll probably be working in. Yes. Good morning, Dr. Numbart, everyone. So Toco Moffitt, the Program Administrator for Tuberculosis Control, is on the call and I'm going to ask her to open her NextGen so that she can walk you through the process of check-in through check-out. And then we also have Beatrice Njorosh, who's our nurse practitioner, who can probably give you the provider perspective of what data they look at or use. That should cover it, I think. Perfect. Sounds great. Take it away, Toco. I'm opening – good morning. I'm opening my NextGen and also Violetta, who is the PAA. She's there with Beatrice. She's going to help in walking us through the check-in, check-out process. So let me just open my NextGen. And at your site, most of your customers are walk-ins. They're not necessarily referrals, right? They actually show up to your site. So we have an appointment system only, but when a walk-in comes in, of course, we definitely take them based on what their needs are. And also, we have referrals from various places – doctors' offices, hospitals – that we deal with. But that is external to NextGen, right? The referrals, exactly. Referrals and even the appointment. So the appointments – it's not online, where the client can set up their own appointment. That's in a totally different process, right? It's not NextGen. It's in – the check-in is in NextGen. They walk in – I mean, they call to make an appointment, because we put them on our schedule. And then they walk in, you know, for us to open up, you know, a record for them. Okay. Opening – let me open my NextGen. NextGen. I'm sorry. It's taking – It's okay. It's fine. I want to say this probably is the first problem we'll solve in July. Everybody seems to take a year to log into NextGen. I think with the new Dr. Cloud and where it will be sitting, we won't be having this kind of disconnect. Won't take this long. Okay. It's opening. It's – yeah, it's opening slowly, so. It's okay. Sorry about that. That's fine. No problem. And so in the chat, Charisse is asking if you can show where the TB Pax x-ray plays factor, okay? I'm – say it again. I should show what? In your – the TB Pax x-ray. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. So a patient walks in. One second. Toko, we're not seeing your screen just yet. If you could share your screen. Okay. Okay. So let's share the screen. Yeah. Bring a chair. Okay. Are you able to see? I pressed share. Not yet. And share is at – it should be at the top near leave, where it says leave. It should be a button. Yeah. Actually, that is not – that's not the hardest part with the share. I mean, that's to find the screen you want to share. This is true. Once they give you an option, you're like, wait, which name am I in? Very true. How do I share it? And this is – you put yes, no? Okay. You see? No, I don't want – I put no. No? Okay. Yeah, uh-huh. All right. And then let me share my screen. Okay. Oh, let's open up the screen. No? So do you think maybe Beatrice could share her screen, since Violetta is with her, and Violetta can walk through the check-in process, Toco? Oh, actually, Violetta's here with me now. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay, thanks. Okay, can you – now that we have – Share? Are you able to see the screen? No. Not yet. I'm doing share. But there's a screen. Oh, something's coming up. Yes. Yes, I guess. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, so Violetta will walk you through. Okay, so when the client comes in or call, but it's different. So I ask for identification, the ID, and click on a chart. If the client has a chart already, has an account. So once I verify the client, I click on chart. I click on chart here. Let's see. Okay, and type the DOB, date of birth. And I click on a file, you know, and I see, you know, the list if the client has already an account. If the client – Is it possible to zoom in a little bit, or am I the only one that sees that extremely small? I have a very big screen, Neil. Can you zoom on your screen at the bottom? Does that work for you? Does that make it better? Yeah, it just expands too much. That's all right. I'll change the resolution on my monitor. It should be good. Okay, let us know. Yes. I don't know if you can make it a little bigger. It's hard to make it bigger when you're in there. Yeah, it's hard to make it big. It's good. My resolution was off for some reason. Thanks. Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead. All right, an open chart. And I type the date of birth here in this space. Should I type, you know, the date of birth? No, because he's going to see the clients, the list of the clients. Okay. And do you want, Violeta, to open up any chart? Yes, just don't put any new information. Yeah, there's some test ones, right? If you have tests, you can use them. Sure. So, should we write just tests? Yeah, if you search for tests, there should be some subjects. Yeah, I think the first name is Melanie Tess. I think Melanie Tess, you know. Let's do the ones that are entered by IT. So, let's, or the ones that, let's do tests. And then can you just search for like female or male? Oh, okay, that, yeah, yeah, that's true. Test, okay. Test and the last name. Yeah, that's good. First name, female, that's a good idea. First name, female, female, okay, female. And then. And date of birth? No, no, no, no. Just search, yeah. Just search. Everybody changes their date of birth, so. Okay, apparently, I have to do this. I have to do this. I have to do this. I have to do this. I have to do this. I have to do this. I have to do this. I have to create a chart in that case. Sometimes the client has already a chart. So, I give it the RoteSleep. The sleep we have, the physical, the paper, to update the information. So, when the client give me the RoteSleep back to me, so I input the information, update the information to NextGen. But this, in that case, you know, we don't have a chart, apparently. So, I have to enter all the information, all the red ones. So, for social security, I have to type 9999, because obviously, you know, we don't, the client doesn't have social security, which is sensitive information. And for phone number, I input her or his phone number and address all the red ones. Because if not, the system doesn't, you know, let me through, you know, for the next screen. So, do you want her to fill in the red, so we can go to the next screen? Yes. Okay. You can click find, Violet. I think you clicked new when you put in the name. Yeah, because it should have a chart for that. Fine, yeah. Yeah, but you know, I have to enter all the information. But just, okay, one second, Violeta. So, if you can go back to the screen, because I want to just explore this a little bit. So, if you put a name in, and you don't click find, and you click new, it gives you this. Okay, so the DrCloud team, I'm just asking them about normal functionality, because this shouldn't be like this. If you click find or new, if the person exists, it should just pull up the record. All right, correct. Correct, right. Okay, all right. Violeta, if you go back and just click find for us. Okay. But for clarification, if she was going to put in the exact same information, the system would have prompted her that there's already an existing patient that exists, and the user can either choose to override it, which they shouldn't, if it's the exact same patient, or they can, you know, go back and select the patient that was supposed to be selected. So, it would have prompted, if the exact same information, if the date of birth and gender is off, then it would not. Right, but in the other system that we have, we do this up front. We don't let them get to this part first. So, we do it in one. So, we force the search, is what we do, is what we say. Yeah, same in our system. If there's a duplicate detected, it'll prompt. Yeah, we force the search up front. If you can, if you go back. To go back? Yes, and just hit find, so we can, because we know how the chart's created and stuff, we just want to get past that. Okay, so do find. Find. And then it gives us. Which one do you want? Which ones do you guys say test female? Is that the one in Cherise? Female, female adult. Test female adult. Okay, the one at the bottom. Two, three. Yeah, third one. The third one open. The third one? Okay. Yes. Okay. Not open. Open? Open. I can see it. Open. Oh my gosh. So little. Don't miss. Open. Okay. All right. All right, so this pension has a chart. And we succeed. I have to check if the pension has, you know, some checks x-ray. So by clicking here in this, what is this? I can see. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Yeah, has the stuff, checks x-ray. I click on checks x-ray. Okay, and yes, has the stuff. So I bring, you know, the last check x-ray. Just this same information and give it to the nurse. With the rotisserie together. And when the client give me the rotisserie. So I, maybe the client move to another place. Another, you know, has another address. And then I input a new address, a new phone number. So I'll update the information in other words. Okay, and then. Let me see. Let's see. Wait we'll see. Okay, okay, so um, uh, let's see. There's female, right? There's female. There's female. Uh, fine, right? Fine. Oh. Fine, it's fine. Fine. Okay, the third one. Okay, open. Um, open, open. Yeah, open, but in that case, I have to schedule. If it's a screening, I have to um, enter, you know, the for example, the client come or the client call for appointment. Um, let me put, I place it here. So, new one appointment. Uh, we come here. There's female. There's female. Fine, the third one. Uh, open, right? I'm hoping. Okay. Oh, I click on okay. Um, I click a TB visit. Uh, maybe if, um, the client comes, um, from the shelter, I put, I enter, you know, here housing. Housing. This is just, uh, details. In detail, I maybe shelter, you know, in Rockville shelter or maybe it's in Gaithersburg shelter. I put some information here. For example, naval shelter. Naval shelter details. And I click on okay. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. Click that. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, right? Close. Okay, but I, so I am now, so that. So that. It will be on my, it will be under me. Under you? Under most of your, uh. Yeah, should be here, right? Right. Oh, but I put here, the client. I can see it's too tiny. No, it doesn't go there because it's in my. Oh, really? Okay. So, yes, I place the appointment. I made already an appointment under Miss Toco. Do you see it? Can you see it? Yeah. Okay, so when the clients comes in the day of the appointment. I right click and I check in the client. Check in the client. And once again, you know, I check the ROTES lip and update the information. Each one, you know, HIPAA privacy, HIPAA, you know, update the date. What else? All these one. So, all these one. So, I here, you know, I enter the name of Beatrice or Dr. Malone. And I click on here so that they enter to the USAID. Here, for example, if the person enter 1-1-2003. It's a homeless, it's a housing, homeless. I verify this one, demographics, all the information, phone number, and then I click on here. It doesn't verify all the information, I check in the client. I enter here Beatriz, the nurse practitioner name. All right, I'm clicking. There, I know billable. Know billable. Close, close. And that's it, and this is how checking clients. You have questions, any questions? Select them. Yeah, it's pretty straightforward so far. Is there any eligibility, checking, or criteria for this population, clients? No. Sometimes we have clients from school, rocking horse, MAT, medical assistant treatment, pregnancy. Also we have housing, already show housing. And then, you know, I scan the paper, you know, the referral, the HEPA IDs, and I, you know, into NextGen. And, yeah, this is part, you know, most of the summaries. Thank you. I just wanted to mention currently for this particular program, it's a non-billable program. So it's the other programs will look a little different. So that's why you might feel like something's missing. This one's always non-billable. Yes, currently, yes, yes. I just wanted to mention that's a big difference. You'll see the other ones. There's a rocking horse in there, which means that it probably pulls residents or patients in. So some of that stuff isn't manual entry. Is that right? No. When the rocking horse comes, the rocking horse call us to make an appointment. So the chart is already created, you know, by rocking horse. But, you know, they send a client with a referral, you know, with a historical immunization record and referral. And obviously, you know, they have to come also bringing, you know, the IDs, passport, any kind of thing. So we put it, you know, in NextGen. Do you need to see, since the appointments on the nurse practitioner schedule, what she does when she sees the client? Do you need to see that piece? Yeah. We can see as much of the end-to-end workflow, please, with all the different users and roles. That's helpful. Okay. So Beatrice, are you able to pick that up from here? Yes, sure. Okay. Please share. The patient test. Okay. Can you see my screen? Yes. Okay. So I have female test here. And the first thing I do is create an encounter for today's date. And I think I'll walk you through this. This can be done by me or the nurse that sees the patient up front. So they'll come in here, and then they'll do an intake of the patient. Select specialty. And for us, it's internal medicine. We're going to do office visit. And then the nurse will come and record an intake comment and say the patient is here for this and that, and save and close. And then also add the vital signs right here. Put all that data there. If it's just a nurse visit, then they will also come here understanding orders and select office visit. Find the diagnosis, like if they're coming just to be tested for TB, and it's going to be good for the diagnosis. For us, it's Z11.1. Screening for TB. And put in the details, like sputum test or something. This order, and then okay. But if it's a visit, then the provider will come here and create a stop note. And then we're going to say this 17-year-old is here for whatever they're here for. It's their first visit. We'll go under initial assessment, put in their history and physical information, and then go ahead and put in their past history. Review of systems. The vital signs probably will auto-populate based on what the nurse has already put in the exam. And then you come here and put in their plan. And you put in your diagnosis and say it's pulmonary TB. Put that there. And you'll see what your plan is. Save and close. The other thing you would do is come under medications and prescribe whatever medication you need to put in. You'll see it's doing one, we're sampling. And it gives you your warnings. And then you put in your information and accept the order. And you will also be able to see what the patient has been on, what's active, what's not active on the medications module. And then there's also the other module for lab work. And if you click on that, you can see the tests, previous tests, which have been done. You can also put in new orders over here under labs. And either do, for us, we use Quest or the state lab. And you can put in whatever orders. Usually the nurses will do this, but as a provider as well, we can do that. And then we have them. So what happens right now is the providers write the orders or manually or just say verbally, like, yeah, we need a CBC, CMP. And then the nurse will come in and put in the order in the computer and do the test. Same thing for x-rays. The providers will say they want an x-ray and the nurse will come in and put in the order for the x-ray. And so if I'm putting in an x-ray, I put in the diagnosis, put in the x-ray here, and the time. Then you go through all these questions here and then save and send. And when you hit send, it goes, it's supposed to, I'm sorry. Once you put in all the information and hit send, I'm just going to do it so you can see what happens. It's supposed to go to the radiology department and they can see it and do the test. Hi, Patrice, this is Charisse from IT. Can you expand a little bit more when you say that once you click on the save and send and it goes to the radiology department, can you speak to what happens there in terms of do they need to re-enter in the patient's information or does it send that information to their computer so that they can do the x-ray? Can you walk through them getting the lab order and then what happens when you guys get the lab results back? I'm sorry, the x-ray results back, sorry. Yes, thank you. So for the x-ray, once we hit save and send, it shows up on their screen. They have a screen that has name and patient information. And then they do the x-ray and the image shows up in the x-ray room. It also can be seen by the doctor in their office. And eventually, we are able to see it. Hold on one second. Yeah, so eventually we can see the x-ray. In NextGen, I'm trying to see if once it's done, there's a way we can see it on NextGen. I'm not able to pull up the screen. Once it's done, there's a way we can see it on NextGen. I'm not able to pull up that information because I guess there's no x-ray that's been done on this patient. But we can see the image on NextGen, but the report itself is sent by the radiology company to the clinic. And then we have to scan that report into NextGen. So the actual report, the written report from the radiology company doesn't show up in the EHR. It's scanned into the EHR. Okay. Beatrice? Oh, sorry, Kim, you got your hand up. Yes, I think she covered it. I wanted to mention that when we transitioned to NextGen, the x-ray image issue was a bit of a bumpy road, for lack of a better description. And it's because it goes to the PACS system, which is a separate system. And so that system had to figure out how to communicate with both NextGen and, you know, the x-ray provider. So I just want to mention that. I don't know all the details, but that x-ray piece is a little bit disjointed. Hopefully it'll be smoother going forward. We were eventually able to get the images available in the EHR, but it took some coordination with IT and the radiology vendor. So, Kim, and I wanted to kind of add something along those lines. So for me, I am trying to figure out physically what is happening, right? So someone is in an office in Dennis Avenue. They're processing a customer. The customer gets service. The request for the x-ray is done in NextGen? Yes. Okay. So once this is done, it interfaces with the PACS system? Correct. And they're supposed to get it immediately? Like, what is the timeframe for this x-ray? How do they know something is sitting there? What's our relationship with that space? And I'm very green to this. If I'm asking something, that's obvious. I apologize. Okay. Yes, there is a manual part where we have the route slip. I think we shared the route slip last time. Yes, I have the route slip. But I want the rest of the team to know, like, what really happens. Because it's not just a system-to-system talk. There's some other stuff happening that I want to kind of elevate. Is that okay? Sure. So that route slip, which starts with Violetta at the front desk, and the patient fills out the information, is also used by the nurse. Like, when she gets the vitals, she will handwrite them on the route slip. And then when she orders the x-ray on the computer, she takes the route slip to the radiology department. And then she will walk to the radiology technician and tell him, we need an x-ray. Beatrice, thank you so much. It's important that we know that there's some people walking around here, right, to make sure the other side knows what's going on. And I think that's where I couldn't quite understand. So the radiology department is in the same building? Yes. Yes. And, you know, by the grace of God, it is, because sometimes it's not, right? So we have this situation where it is there. But if it's not there, how do you even get this across? But I wanted the Dr. Cloud team to understand that there are some physical things happening in between the systems talking to each other. So once you bring the sleepover, is it the same day? Do you kind of package them, and then you bring them over at the end of the day? Like, how do you do it? So once the x-ray is done, then the same radiology technician will walk it to the doctor's office, and then the doctor will sign off on it. Then we have to wait like a day or two for the actual report to come back from the company, and that is sent to our radiology technicians, and then they will give it to me, the report. Okay. Is that sign-off component electronic? I mean, I can see there's a sign-off button up there. No, no. That sign-off button is initially on that Roush MIM. But if you see here where it says PAQ, it will show up under the PAQ. The x-ray will show up for the provider to sign off on the PAQ, but the real stuff happens on paper because it's real-time. But they will sign it electronically once they get the report in? Yeah, way later, later. So, Beatrice, I just want to clarify, particularly for Neal, because we're working on interfaces. There's an interface to the TB PAX, the actual machine, but there is no interface to the radiologist that's reading the report. There's no interface to that right now. And that's why it's a manual process. Yes. There is no interface. The only way we get the reports on NextGen is by scanning the paper. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Thanks, Jeruse. Can I go back and ask a question about the TB? So I'm assuming most times the nurse does the PPD read. Is that right? Yes. And at this clinic, we usually don't do the PPDs, mostly except for small children. But, yes, the nurse will do the PPD read. Okay. Is there an electronic signature to that component? There is one. I can demonstrate here. Is it like zero to three or something like that that you do at that clinic? Yes. There's a place to document on NextGen for it. Okay. And do you want to hear about the labs? Yeah. I can say something about the labs. Okay. So as far as labs are concerned, if it's Quest, the results will show up here. And if it's some of these paid labs will show up here. But that's one area right now. Like Sputum labs do not populate on NextGen automatically. There's no connection. There used to be one up until, I guess, like 2020. And then I think they were hacked. The state was hacked. And after that, we've never been able to see their lab reports directly on NextGen. You have to scan them. From the state lab? From the state lab, yeah. And is there a signature component on this, too? No. Okay. Oh, yeah, there it is, graphing. I was wondering if there was graphing on there. Okay. Is there a reason that state lab is used? I saw Quest 2 over LabCorp? For lab ordering? Yes. The state lab provides testing at no cost for certain infectious disease programs. And they actually prefer for us to use them because they track the results and put them in their database. And it's quicker. And some of them they send to the CDC. So they like to keep track of some of those ID infectious disease labs. Others we pay for through private labs. Okay. Thank you. What about any kind of reports that you guys specifically run or data that you need to pull out frequently? Any need for that? So we do use CRISP quite a little bit to get the data. We use CRISP quite a little bit to get the history. And that's actually one of the questions we had is whether this system will be in any way linked to CRISP or the patient information will be linked to CRISP. Yeah, I got information from Sharice yesterday on that. So that's, yeah, yeah, we'll be interfacing with CRISP. Oh, that's great. At first my understanding is that it's going to be related to pulling back the values, but currently they're starting the process of the other clinical data bi-directional with CRISP. So once they get that done, then I assume the expectation is that you'll be doing the same thing. And it's not a lot of setup difference. So once they're ready, it should be pretty easy. Okay. And the other piece for us that we use a lot is the contact, as you can imagine. in TB cases have a lot of contacts. So- That was on my list of questions to get to. Oh, okay, sorry. Contact tracing, yeah. Yeah, so right now the index case is not linked to their contacts on NextGen. We just know who they are manually based on the paper chart. Okay. And we also have like big contact investigations with like a hundred people, but I don't know, they're not connected in the EHI. You're not able to pull that data out of NextGen, right? Not as like a custom report type thing or anything? No, no, we don't. All right, that takes care of contact tracing. And I'm sorry, also back to reports. I don't know if you saw my comment. Toko also does have several reports that she runs routinely. I don't know if you need to see those or not, but just wanted to mention that as well. Yeah, I mean, if you have a quick second to show us just kind of where and how you run it, what information specifically it has. The other thing, Kim, Toko, that if you guys could do for us is if you could tell us ideally what your management space look like. You don't have one now, right? So there's no management dashboard, but the things you use to organize the work, right? Oh, is there a spreadsheet? And on the spreadsheet, I keep track of this, this, this and this because there's no way to do that in NextGen. So it probably doesn't exist in NextGen right now, but what do you use to manage the program? Probably more Kim than anything, right? So what is that overall high level view that you need to manage a program? What are some of the common things you look at every day? We use a lot of Excel spreadsheets. I'm just going to be honest. Yes. And they're, you know, they're separate ones, right? So we're looking at anything from when someone, a patient comes in who that patient is assigned to. That's one thing, what nurse? We know what provider, because there's a place for that in NextGen, but we don't know, have a place to put the nurse. You know, we don't have a place and I, and get me, you can get mad at me, get me after this meeting, but we don't have a place to track the directly observed therapy visits in the community, right, that right now that's completely done on paper. I think we brought that up before. And it would be really great to be able to do that because that's a data point that is really important, right? That's a very time intensive, but the only way we can figure that out is using paper, right, and so that would be a great thing. And new on the horizon, if there's a way to pull a report about, we also dispense medications, you know, just to be able to, in addition to the medication inventory, if that's a piece we'll have access to, just to be able to pull from, I guess I don't know where it would pull from, maybe the prescriptions module, just a way to pull a report that says, this is what we dispense for today. Those are a couple of things that I can think of off the top of my head, I'm a little rusty, and Toko may want to add something, but I know the directly observed therapy has been something that's been on paper and we just can't figure out how to make it more efficient for the team and be able to track that data. Okay, okay. Do me a favor, Kim, if you can write all this up and send to me. Okay. And I do have your, I have your spreadsheets, don't I? I have a copy of your spreadsheets. We can get them to you, Toko can, we can get them to you if you need them. Yeah, I think I have some of them, if you can just send them to me and I'll put them in our project folder. But if you can send me that management perspective, that'll be great. Happy to, thank you so much. One of the things that we're thinking about is, you know, can patients have a portal where they can check their own results, test results? For instance, we just did a large contact investigation and we had a hundred and something, a hundred and eighty something results. So we had to manually send them results, you know, as opposed to mail the results to them, as opposed to them checking, yeah. Right. No, I think the client portal is one of those features that we'll try to turn on in the new year. I know there's going to be some learning, so I'm working on how we get the community aware that this change is coming. Cause sometimes, you know how we serve in Montgomery County, we don't just put stuff up out in the community, but that's something that is with the doctor cloud system that we're going to turn on from the new year, the client portal. So Toko, if you could show us where you run the reports and type of reports that you run. Thank you. Let's see. Okay, I go to under reports. What? Toko, you got to share your screen again. It went away. Okay. I'll go under reports. I can see it's so small. Reports here. I'm going to go under, are you able to see the screen? It's so small. Yes, yes. I'll go under TB. I'm going to go under TB. And then this is what I normally use. And duplicated counts. And this is where, if I want to see the number of people that we saw. I'm sorry, it's so small, I can barely see it. Someone. It will run the reports of people that we've seen in the clinic and duplicated reports of people that we've seen in the clinic. Okay. For the year. I don't think you have to run them. I think we're interested in what the information is that you're most commonly trying to pull out of the system. So this is kind of a daily census type report. Okay. If so, maybe I could have a summary of all the quantifier on tests that we do. If I can have the summary of that, that would be great. Would you run that daily or is that weekly? Monthly? It could be monthly. Anything else you specifically run? For the most part, that's what I normally run when I write the annual reports. We also look at, excuse me, Toko, because I just want to add this in case this is something we can continue to do, is we also run a report on each provider or nurse, each resource person, how many patients they've seen. And that's usually done monthly to help us manage caseloads and make sure we're keeping track of the size of caseload and also just kind of productivity type things. We also run a report for PPDs, the TB skin test, because the TB program is responsible for reporting any positive ones to the state. And so, that's another report that we run. Number of x-rays is helpful as well. Number of x-rays ordered? Yeah, that we've done, yes. Those are things that we're often asked for. And it's just so nice to have a report and just pull it. And as I said, what will be new is the number, the amount of dispensing we've done. And that would be daily. Okay. That's the only questions I had, unless Chris or Ryan have anything. And a question, would there be a way of for each nurse to have somewhere where they can put their patients and track their patients instead of paper records, where they could come back and say, I have patient A and put them in the system, as opposed to using paper records, since we're trying to get rid of paper records so far? Go ahead. Sorry, Chris. I don't think- If you guys want to show us your system now. I don't know if you're ready, Chris. Yeah, I'm ready. What did we want to see today? So some of the capabilities as it relates to this work. Chris, did you hear her question about nurses being able to see their caseloads and stuff? Yeah. So we have a few ways we could do that. One would be the dashboard where I can see my caseload. The other would be I could run a service report of services provided in the given timeframe. So yeah, let me just, I'll go ahead and share my screen here. Okay. Well, Chris is getting ready. You know, what I observed is the scheduling and the intake process and the check-in, there's a lot of similarities from what we've seen, but there's pieces with the TB packs that we are building out right now. So that's not currently inside of Dr. Cloud, but we were working to stand that up. So I think what Chris might be able to show is something related to medication administration or as well as the, like you said, Chris, the case management. You lost your screen, Chris. There you go. Okay. So the caseload view would be accessible here. And this shows me a list of the clients that I currently have assigned to me. And I can also see for anybody that I may supervise, I can also see their caseload by clicking on their name and their name. And I can also see if they're in a hospital by clicking on their name. And then this shows me their caseload. And this also has information about rules that are set up at the agency level for things that need to be done on certain timeframes. And this gives me dates of when they're due and also a little icon indicating my level of compliance with that. So this is showing me that this red frowny face here means that I'm not in compliance with this because it was due on this date and I'm not done with it yet. And this up here shows me the different icons and what they mean in terms of it being in compliance. But one of the things that I wanted to look at with you because you were showing medications and prescribing, if I go to the client record here, and then I do have an option over here to prescribe on the sidebar menu. And so I could go prescribe a medication, but I can also see what medications are currently taking on this screen. If I scroll down over here on the right-hand side, it shows me a list of their medications here. And then I can also include their inactive medications by checking the box here. And it shows me in red, the ones that they're not currently taking. And then the ones that are in black are what they're currently taking. And it shows me the pharmacy that that was sent to if we prescribed it. And then I can also go to the prescriptions area and see the prescriptions. And I can go create a prescription by clicking on edit there and then go to e-prescription. And this is going to allow me to create a prescription to send to the pharmacy that I'm choosing for this particular client. So once it loads up here, then I would go ahead and create a new prescription for them. And then this is where I would put in the drug that we'd be prescribing. And we would just choose the name of the medication, and then we would choose the dosage. And then we would put in the directions to the patient for what they should be taking, how frequently and as needed or as directed. And then we can type in any additional directions that should go on the label here. And then this is where we can choose the pharmacy that we're sending it to, but it's just going to default to the one we last sent to. And we've put in the day supply, and then whether or not, you know, how many refills, whether or not we permit substitution by the pharmacist, and then any additional notes to the pharmacist we could put in and then review that prescription. It's going to show us what the label's going to look like. And then because we're connecting with a SureScript-backed prescribing platform, it is also going to give us suggestions for price discounts or, you know, other types of things. It's also going to connect with authorizations for insurance. So there's a lot of functionality built in here. It'll also give us contraindications, things like that. So then we can save this prescription and then a prescriber would come in and just select it and then send it to the pharmacy by putting in their password. So that's how the prescriptions would work in the system. And then in terms of reporting, we have a lot of reports that are available in the system out of the box. I can click on reports, and I see these are all the types of reports that are available. And I can click on the type of reports to see a list of all the reports that are available in there. And one of them would be the provider service report. This is where I can see the services that were provided by, you know, any providers that I select here. So I can choose the provider that I want to include in my report. And then this shows me the dates of service, who the patient was, the forms that were filled out, and the status of the completion of those forms. So I can see that these two forms were 0% complete, and then this one was 100% complete, and I can see all of that in this report. So that's an example of a report that gives us details around services provided to clients. So any questions or anything else you wanted to look at? So a quick question on the report, Chris. So for the reports, is there a library and a description of each report? Is there something in Dr. Claude that I could see? Do you have a, or like a, almost like a data dictionary about where it comes to report? Like this report, this is what it does, there's a description, here's what it's for. Uh, we could provide that. Perfect. Yeah, I mean, most of the reports are pretty self-explanatory in terms of what they're giving you, but where there's additional information needed, if you, like for example, if you hover on the name of a report here, it's showing me this report is a tabular representation of the count of patients appointments for each day in a selected month. So then if I hover on the next one, it shows me this report is used to generate a list of monthly visit appointment and will display name by category of the appointment. So, I mean- No, no, no, that's great, but for my purpose, I need that- A list, yeah. Yeah, like I need that set of information, if that's okay, because I need to look at the whole thing. Yeah, Bollock is sure is on this call. Bollock, sure, can we provide that to them? Is that something you could generate for us? Yes, Chris. Okay, perfect. Because we have the document, right? That document you're talking about, the report document, what we have. Do we have a list of all the reports and a description of what they- Yes, yes. Yeah, could you share that? I just don't know where that is. Yeah, I'll check it and I'll share it. Okay, yeah, that'd be great. So yeah, we can provide you with that. Okay, and on our side, Sharisa, is there a list like that on our side? A list of- Reports, yes. I don't need the report itself, just everything that is available in the library. In NextGen that is canned? Or whatever we're using, canned or not. Well, no. If it's whatever we're using, no, because those would be user-specific reports that they created. So that's not something IT would have. It would be in NextGen, but it's not something that we would have documented, because users can create their own reports. But I can look to see what canned reports NextGen has and see what they have for those. Okay, if I can get a list of that. But there's no way for me to get a list of, even from the backend, a list of reports that users are created by whom, no? No, that's a separate question. You are asking, I thought what you were asking was a description of the reports. No, they probably won't have description. I get that. Okay, that's not the question I thought you were asking. What do you say, Ceri? Sorry, you're going in and out. Am I going in and out for everyone else or just you? I don't know. Everybody else is the same. Yeah, you're fading a little bit. Yeah, I'm turned up loud. I will look to get that list for you. So I'll look. Okay, but the ones on the NextGen side, you said the canned ones will probably have some description, right? For the canned ones, yes. Okay, perfect. For those that were created by users, we can see, we'll just put out whatever title the user gave to that report. So if it's report one, that's what you'll get. If it says TB report for patients, then that's what you'll get. Yes, whatever description is there. Okay, that's fine. Would I be able to get the name of the user that created it in a program or would that be possible? If it has that information in there, we'll try to get it. Okay, perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, back to you, Neil. I think we just had a question. Oh, yeah. So I had a question about the prescribing side. So in the tuberculosis clinic, we have all our medications here. So we have like our own pharmacy that Toko runs. So does it allow for that? And is there any way to tie that to our inventory or just curious? We do have, I know that with the doctor first and the prescribing, you can send it to any pharmacy that they're not going to limit that. But in terms of having it get out of the inventory, that would be an interface that we would have with an EMAR also prescribing entity. And we'd have to talk about the functionality there, but it is possible with that. Hi, this is Jamila. I have just a quick question. On your dashboard, is there a dashboard that like the management can use like to see the productivity of staff or what's pending, what's closed, how many cases? Is there like a dashboard for like a management dashboard for anything like that? Well, it would be that caseload view. As a supervisor, I can choose to see the people that I supervise, their dashboards. And then these deficiency notifications or compliance can be set up for any type of form in the system or treatment plan. And you can enable those here. We can just turn on the ones you want to see that they're, you know, whether or not they're in compliance with those. And then you could see that here as well. So, yeah, I mean, the dashboard in terms of completion and compliance is available and I can see it for all of the people that I supervise. Okay. So, they can see like the total number of active cases, like in who's doing what, what's pending, any alerts, like who has TB and things like that. Does that dashboard give you that type of data? It's going to give you completion of forms data, like where they're at in terms of completing forms that are due. Okay. Forms. If there's those other kinds of reminders, those would be in your inbox as notifications. Okay. In terms of forms. Okay. But if someone needs to be checked in and checked, like someone wasn't properly checked out, just saying, just in general, would there be any alert? Is there like an end to shift report? Is there a way for the manager to say like, okay, this person hasn't been checked out? You know, what's going on? What's the status? So, I'm just wondering if there's any kind of alerts like that. Yeah, there can be. I mean, those are all things we would configure based on what's needed there. But yeah, I mean, we just, our terminology for checking out is closing the encounter. And when I'm looking at the encounter history here, I can see the date of the service and then the name of the visit type and who provided it. But I can also see the ones that are not in bold are closed and the ones that are in bold are not closed yet. So, those are the ones that are not checked out yet. Okay. All right. And that's the bold. It's in the bold. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yep. It looks like Rishan. You can go ahead and then we'll have a few minutes. This is real quick. Is there a potential to send appointment reminders to people that have emails? And also, is there potential for any client satisfaction surveys? I know it's reaching, but I just thought I'd ask. So, we have a satisfaction survey. So, I'm going to go ahead and send it to you, Rishan. So, we have a satisfaction survey that we built. It's very generic. I don't know if you'd want to use it or not, but it is something we do have available. We can show you that. And then in terms of the reminders to folks, we do have a service that we connect to that we send information about appointments to, and then they can send out those reminders. And it would be any format the client prefers to receive them in. So, email, text, phone call, voicemail, any of those. All happening through the portal, correct, Chris? Yeah, through that vendor, Televox. They're the ones that send out those reminders. Okay. Thank you. So, in terms of the satisfaction survey that Kim was asking about, we create our own. Is that something that can be attached to this service? It could be. You could create that and send it to the portal, as long as it doesn't need to be anonymous. Oh, you mean anonymous wouldn't be? Like a survey that you don't get the person, you don't get identifying information for the client in the survey. If you just want to send them a survey and you know who filled it out, then we can certainly do that. Okay, because we create our own surveys, and unless we can modify yours, we've got to figure out a way to create our own surveys. Yeah. So, you could create it as a form that you could then send to them in the portal. Yeah. Okay. One other thing right before we go. The alerts that come up in, this is a question for Charisse and Selwyn. The alerts that come up in NextGen, is there a list of those? Is that out of the box, or is that something we created for NextGen? All the alerts. I believe there's functionality to create separately. Okay. So, some of them came with NextGen, but some of them we created, right, Charisse? Correct. Okay. Is there a list of those? IT can work on getting a list. Perfect. And where they get triggered. That'd be great. Thank you. I'm not sure about where they get triggered, but we can definitely pull out the list. That would, program staff would probably need to weigh in on where they get triggered. Okay. And for the Dr. Cloud team, do we have something like this for your site, out of the box can, where the alerts are, where they get triggered? Well, we can configure those. So, whatever, I mean, we typically build those as part of the implementation. So, if we get a list of them, then we can build them. Yes. Oh, but you, all right. So, you do it on client ask, not. Yeah. Okay. Yes. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Anything else? I know we're at the bottom of the hour. I want to thank Kim and her team sincerely for walking us through this. If anything else comes to mind, please just send an email over. Kim, send me your management notes and your staff wishlist. That's really, really important. And any of those spreadsheets that you use to do the management now, and I'll put it in the folder for the Dr. Cloud team. Very good. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye. Thank you, everyone. Bye-bye. Bye.",
