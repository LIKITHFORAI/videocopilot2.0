  "text": "Hello, my name is Chris with Dr. Cloud EHR by InSoftech. I'm bringing you another video demonstration. This is on the topic of billing. So we're going to be talking about the billing process in Dr. Cloud EHR and potentially creating claims and also marking claims as billed to essentially mark them as such without actually sending them to a clearinghouse or to a payer. But we also support printing 837s as well as submitting them electronically to the clearinghouse. And we're going to talk about updating the rate tables, the master charge list or usual and customary rates in Dr. Cloud EHR. We're going to talk about ways in which we can handle special scenarios using billing rules related to potentially age of the client or also diagnoses based on specific service codes. And then we're going to talk about the batch claim processing and show that. And then we're going to talk about authorizations and how we can handle those cases where you have partial authorizations that are needed. And then the process for placing clients with collection agencies and a month-end closed report for the general ledger and then also the contract management for payers' contracted rates and how those are edited in Dr. Cloud EHR. So the first thing we're going to talk about is the billing process in general. So I'm going to go to the billing section of Dr. Cloud EHR. And when I first go into the billing area, I'm going to have all these menu options available to me in here. The place where we land when we first come in here is the billing manager, which is the first step in generating the claims to send to the payers. So the first page here, this billing manager section, gives me the ability to filter all of the claims that I need to generate on the basis of all of these different data fields. So I can do based on the authorization status, the bill type, whether it's going to on a CMS 1500 HCFA claim form or UB04 claim form, the current billing status, whether it's been billed or is not billed, the units. And there's lots of filters I have available to me here to find the claims exactly that I need to bill, especially, you know, searching by patient or by insurance company or even to granular level of the service code that I want to bill. So it makes it flexible for being able to find exactly what you're looking for in terms of being able to generate those claims. And so once I select the options for the filter that I have available, then they're going to show up. The filters that I've selected are going to show up over here. So if I want to edit one of these filters, I can also click on it and choose from one of the predefined options for a date range, or I can customize the dates by entering those dates manually here. So if I put in my date range, then I can check my filters over here that I'm selecting. And then I can go ahead and search for the claims that are found in the system based on the parameters that I put in. So I'm going to put in for this year and show all of those claims that are in there. And so down here are my results, and these are the encounters that I can generate the claims for. And so in this dropdown here, we see the insurance that we're billing, and then this is the clearinghouse that this claim is going to be sent to based on the generation of this claim. And obviously, we support multiple clearinghouses, or even we could say that we're just printing off the claim. And so that could be the option that we're saying here is that we're just printing the claim. And so that's all we're going to be doing with that. Or we just want to mark it as cleared, which is essentially marking it as billed. And so for those cases where I need to send to a specific payer for just reporting purposes, I can search for the payer, looking for the insurance company, and then basing. It's a grant funds that I'm looking for, and then I can search for all of those. And then let's just remove some of these other filters here to find some of those in here. So now I'm going to pull up all of the claims that would go to this specific insurance company. Obviously, you'd probably put a date range in there, because when you're doing all-time, you know, a very generic filter like this, it's going to come up with a lot of different results potentially. So in this case, it's showing me that I have no X12 partner or clearinghouse mapped to this particular insurance. But I was able to search based on those. So what I would do is, and we also have this yellow triangle, which is a golden threat alert, which is preventing me from selecting these to bill. So that would be the process. I would check these boxes to select these if I want to generate the claims for them, and then click on Generate Claims. Or if my generation process is very clean, and I know I'm getting paid on these kinds of things to these payers based on them getting through the clearinghouse successfully, I can just say Generate and Submit, and that's going to generate these claims and send them to the clearinghouse all in one click. But I've got these golden threat alerts, which are preventing me from being able to bill that. So what I would need to do is select this, and then click Override, and that's going to allow me to choose the reason that I'm overriding this, and then enter any notes I want to capture for that, and then override it. And then it's going to re-update the page here once I've overridden this, and it's going to allow me to select this now to generate my claim for this. And so then I would click Generate Claims. But in the case of, you know, if this is a grant funds payer and I just need to record the fact that I have a really just a record of a claim at this point, then I would select it and then just say Mark as Cleared, and that's going to change the build status to show it as marked as Billed, which would then essentially remove it from my queue of unbilled claims and allow me to move forward with billing the rest of the claims that I need to generate. So this Mark as Cleared would be what we would recommend if you have those types of payers that you're just doing for record keeping or need to send them at a later date. Or you could generate the claims and then, you know, create or print those if you wanted to or generate reports for those based on what would be needed. So we would want to find out more about the exact requirement for sending those encounters or, you know, the formatting for sending that data to your Medicaid authority for reporting to them. But, you know, if I wanted to generate the claim so I can, again, change my filter here so I can say All Insurance Companies and then look for dates of service in a certain range, so we'll just say this calendar year and then search for all of those. And then what I would do is come over here and select these and go ahead and generate my claims. And when I go to generate the claims, what's going to happen is the system is going to run a claim rules check, which is checking for the data that is available in the encounter for the individuals that we're generating the claims for. And it's looking for any information that's potentially missing from those fields that would go on the claim. And we can indicate in the claim rules specifically what the system should do when that data is missing for each individual field on the claim form. So we can see here that these claims did not generate because there was a failure in the claim rules based on missing information. And then we also have a warning that says we're missing prior authorization for them, which is something that we could even require and say that's required to be able to generate the claims. We have at the bottom here this one that did generate the claim. So we did get one claim generated out of those that we selected. And we can easily view this claim by clicking on the claim number and it shows us a worksheet view that shows us the information that's going to go on this claim in all the boxes and allows us to actually edit the information in any of these boxes if we wanted to add any information that should go on the EDI file to the payer. And then we can even submit it from here if we want to. We can save our changes. I'm just going to close this. We can also download the X12 file, which is the EDI file if we want to see the EDI file, the data that's actually going to the clearinghouse. And then I would close this window or I could print it off or export it to Excel to give to my billing team or maybe front office staff to capture this information that's missing to be able to generate claims. So those claim rules can be modified on a per-payer level or even down to the level of the service code that we're generating the claims for. So if I go into the practice administrative section of the system, I can come down to the claim rules. And then for each claim type and each specific insurance or insurance company, insurance type, or facility, I can set up a set of rules around what data field should go onto the claim form. And so if I go to edit the rules, then here's where I can set the parameters that should cause this rule set to apply. And then I can indicate notifications that I need to go out based on claims not getting generated. And then in this area down here, we have the box numbers on the claim form, all of the titles of the boxes for the claim form fields. And then this is the data that's pulling into that from Dr. Cloud EHR, which the nice thing about these fields is I can actually just type in something to go in that box if I want to. So for example, in box 24J, if I come down here, if I want that to be a facility NPI in this box, I can just type that facility NPI. And that would be what goes on the claim for every time the claim gets generated based on this rule set getting applied for that specific claim that gets generated. Then over here, I can indicate what should happen when that information is potentially missing from generated in that claim. So I can ignore it, and I can go ahead and generate the claim if that's missing. Or I can notify the staff in a warning and still generate the claim, but not stop the claim from generating. And then in this case, we can also select to not generate the claim and notify us that that claim could not get generated because that information was missing. So these are our claim rules that can be configured in your system, again, for any payer, any facility, and even down to the service code level is a new feature that we have available. So let's talk about managing our rate tables. So if I go into practice, and then administrative, and then go down to the services area, this is where I can edit the rate tables for all of the different codes in the system. So I can go into CPT-4 code types and display all of those, or I can search by a specific code. So if I wanted to say 0913 and then search for that code, it shows me just that code. And I can make changes up here by clicking edit, and that allows me to make changes to either the code, or add a modifier, or change the description, or I can also set the method of billing for this code, whether it's going to be units based on time, amount of time spent, or session based. And then we can also edit the fee for this charge, and we can set it up so that the fee is based on a date range. So I can, every year as those rates for usual and customary need to change on the master charge table, I can add a new time frame with a different rate. So as my rates increase, I can edit the end date so that it stops. So I can just say this should stop as of the first of the year, or the end of last year, and then update that, and then add another option here where I can say as of this year, beginning of this year, this charge, oops, going back multiple years here, this charge is going to be 550 now, and that should go to the end of the year if I wanted to set that now, or I can just leave it blank to continue until we update the rates again. So I would submit that. And now this, oh, it looks like I went, oh, I need to make this 1-1. So this is starting 1-1, and then submit that. So now I've entered 550 for the new rate for that service code beginning the first of the year. And I can also go back and apply this to the encounters that are created for that service code as of that date, which is a nice feature for updating prices after the fact if you do that a few days later after the charge has actually gone into effect. And then I would close that. So that's how I can edit the master charge table. And the other thing I want to talk about is when I'm in the billing area and I'm looking at those claims to generate. So the clinical process would be to capture notes and create encounters, and the service codes are attached via the template that I can create and manage in the templates area. But those service codes and modifiers and such can be changed based on the billing rules that we can set up. So we can go into practice administrative, and we can set up billing rules where we can indicate that for any specific service that we're providing, we can say as of this date range, and then we can say if the insurance company of the client is of this type, which could be Medicaid or could be Medicare, or we can select a specific insurance company, we can also look at next levels of insurance or look at the facility or location of that service being provided. We can also look at the age range of the individual. So if their age is under 18, for example, and they wouldn't qualify for a specific payment for a specific service, or we wanted to change the charge or the service code or the modifiers based on the age of the recipient of the service, we could use the billing rule to indicate that here by putting in the age of the individual that this rule should apply to, and then that would allow us to set a different code or modifier or billing status for that service based on that age of the individual. We can also look at the education or certification level of the provider. We can look at the amount of time spent in the service based on time that's captured in there, and then we can look at whether or not it's telehealth, provided via telehealth. So these are our billing rules, and they can apply when the encounter's closed, and that changes based on the parameters that we put in here. So that's how we would handle either changing something that needs to be changed based on age, which if something becomes not billable after a certain point of age, we could implement that. And then we also have service rules, which allow us to create a rule that says, you know, for specific diagnoses, we would only be able to allow specific types of services, and that would actually stop the encounter from getting created when that service is not eligible for that specific diagnosis. So that's, again, it's a different area of the system where we have the ability to create service rules that will allow us to do those kinds of things. So next I'm going to talk about submitting the claims in a batch claim process. So if I go to the billing area, where I start again in Billing Manager, I can go to the Claims Manager, and this is where I can see the claims that have been generated and submit them to my payers. So this is a claim that we generated earlier. So if I include a larger date span, so if I say in the last 60 days, show me those claims that have been created, then I could select them all and then click Submit. And that's going to send them to the clearinghouse that is assigned for that payer, and it's going to generate those files and send them electronically behind the scenes. So submitting claims is as simple as selecting them after I create them or generate them and then submit them by selecting them. So that's the batch claim process going to the clearinghouse. And then, so the way we would handle the next item to talk about is the prior authorizations and how we would handle authorized units that are less than the actual units. And so one of the things I want to show is the feature that we have, which is allowing us to, when creating an appointment for an individual, so I can search for and select my individual here, and we can display co-pay information based on the, you know, information that we have entered for this individual based on the facility. We can also display specific notes based on what a front office person may have put in or somebody's put into the system to remind whoever's creating this appointment about this individual and collecting money up front. But we also have the ability to display authorization information right from the appointment. So I can see where we're at in terms of the authorized units for specific services, how many we've consumed. And so if I am creating an appointment and I want to make sure that we're not exceeding the authorized units, I can check here to make sure that we're not in a point where we're, you know, using up all of the authorizations that we have or the units we have authorized. And we can even set up the system to prevent an encounter from getting created if the authorized units are exceeded for specific service codes. So if that's desired, we can set the system to do that. Otherwise, we can also just pop up a warning that says that this service may not be authorized because you've exceeded the number of units available for the service. Or we can just not do anything. So those are the options related to authorized units and how we would handle, you know, making sure that we're using all of the authorized units but also not overusing or exceeding the authorized units. And then I want to talk about placing somebody with collections. So that's done via the collections aging report under our financial reports area. So I would go into my collections aging report. And in order to place somebody in collections, first I would look and see where we're at in terms of, you know, money that's outstanding from our different facilities. So I can select that as a filter. And then it's going to show me here's all of my outstanding balances. And for those that are out past 90 days, I can go ahead and select this. So if I say this person, I want to place them in collections, I can select them and then come up here and say I want to go ahead and update their chart to indicate that they're now in collection status. And I want to send this information to my collections agency. So I can export them as a CSV file that I can send to the collections agency or I can export them to the collections agency. So it says, asking me if I want to go ahead and do that. I'm saying, okay, yes, I have acknowledged now that that person is now in collections. And then here's the data file that could get sent to my collections agency. So now if I pull up that individual in the system and I view their chart, there's going to be in the billing section. a big red notice now that says that this person is in collection. So that's how we handle placing someone in collections and the ability to display that in the chart that's visible to anybody that's accessing their chart that has access to the billing information here could see that they are in fact in collections. And then let's talk about the general ledger options. So under billing if I come down to the accounting ledger area and I go to my export I would just choose my accounting period and then search for the transactions that are available in that period. So I might go back a few months here and look at let's just go back to November of last year and search for the transactions that are available there. And so it shows me here's a list of the transactions. This is a demo system so it's not gonna have a lot of data in it. But you know when I when I go to do my export I can see a preview of what transactions are included in that report and then export this export this as a new Excel file CSV file that I would then import to my general accounting software general ledger software. And it would contain all these transactions that would then get imported into my software. And so that's how I would export to general ledger. And then as it relates to contract management so I have different contracts with payers that I want to manage the amounts for that I can receive in terms of money for services provided. So I can go into practice and then look for the practice area. And this is where I can see all of my payers. And in my payers list in the details for payers if I go into one of these payers I have these two different options here at the very bottom or near the bottom of the options for setting up for this payer. One of them is related to changing the charge. So if we want to actually bill the contracted amount that needs to go on the claim then we can check this box and that would make sure that the contracted amount that we enter is going to be what's going to go on the claim for that service. And if we don't expect to get an electronic ERA or EOB from the payer we can also automatically enter an adjustment into the ledger of the patient when we're generating those claims or generating those or in closing the encounter we can automatically post the adjustment. And so if we're not changing the charge we can just post the adjustment so we know exactly where we're going to be at in terms of receivables or if we want to change the charge to go out then we wouldn't necessarily need to automatically post an adjustment because we're automatically changing the charge that goes out on the claim. So the amount that we're billing would be the contracted amount. So if I go back to the payer list here and go into the manage contracts area I can add a contract which I can give it a name and a date range and select the specific facilities that it applies to and then I can choose my services which I want to you know set the contracted rate for and so then it shows me when I select the service it's an $850 service but this payer will only pay $600 for this service so we go ahead and put that contracted rate in there and then we would go ahead and save this contract. So for all the services where our payers are going to pay us less we can put in the contracted rate and this is showing us the usual and customary master charge rate for that service and we can then put the contracted rate and again the behavior of the system as it relates to the contracted rate is going to be based on that setting in the payer level where we're indicating what to do with that contracted rate whether change the charge on the claim or go ahead and post the adjustment if we're not changing the charge. And then with these contracted rates then I can look in my reports under the financial reports and I can look in a report called the the I can look at my net revenue report which is going to show me my expected revenue based on contracted rates so I can choose the the facilities and I want this to apply to I can choose my date range and then I can go ahead and search for all of those charges and so this report is going to show me the usual and customary charge the contracted rate that was entered the expected adjustment and then here's the actual payments and then the actual adjustments so we're able to see all of that in a single report so we know clearly what our expected revenue can be so we can see here's our total of charges and if I had contracted rates for all of these payers then I could see the contracted rate the expected total of contracted rates as opposed to the the total that we have charges for usual customary and then the expected adjustments which should be the difference between the total and the contracted amounts and then the actual payments we've received and then the actual adjustments so we can kind of easily compare those in a report so this has been a demonstration of dr. cloudy HR buying soft tech in the billing section and you know obviously we're happy to show any other information they may have questions about but we look forward to working with you and thank you for your time",
